The great call for each party, the importance in the media and political interests are some of the causes.  Nor is it new knowledge that there are teams with greater economic power than others.  In general, this is due not only to the sports results of each one, but also to the contribution of their owners in the management and institutional management. <\/p>\n<p>With reference to a study carried out by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), it was learned that Paris Saint Germain is the team that sells its tickets at the highest price, on average.  The podium is completed by Chelsea and Arsenal.  Within the top 10, there are three English clubs (Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham), plus those already mentioned, two Spanish (Real Madrid and FC. Barcelona), a German (Bayern Munich) and an Italian (Juventus).<\/p>\n<p>PSG, which has been owned by Qatari businessman Nasser Al-Khelaifi since 2011, has bet since his arrival to be the most powerful club in France and to be able to fight as equals in international tournaments.  The hiring of Neymar Jr. and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, among others, are a clear example of this.<br \/>Therefore, the great expenses that they have for the contracts of the soccer stars, plus the investments for the maintenance of the luxurious stadium, make the tickets to the sporting event even higher.<\/p>\n<p>To all this we must add the experience as such offered by the stadiums in the Old Continent, where beyond the sporting spectacle, a first-class catering, WiFi, Fan Zone and all the comforts of the case are offered.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>If you are looking to have a reference, the Argentine Soccer Super League (SAF) increased the prices of its tickets at the end of 2018 and is close to 400 pesos for each popular (the equivalent of about 10.77 dollars), far from 10 pesos that cost a ticket in 2004.\t\t\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Monday, January 28, 2019 It is no news that soccer is one of the sports that moves the most money in the world.
