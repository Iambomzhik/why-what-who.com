The first is that the channels <strong>Playboy and F\u00fatbol Replay will be on channels 190 and 199<\/strong>, respectively.  All channels blocked at the platform level (as is the case precisely with Playboy) will continue to be blocked despite the change of dial.  However, if we had any other channel blocked <strong>will have to lock it again<\/strong> through the Settings and Channel Blocking section.  Also, if you have favorite channel lists active on your decoder, you must deactivate the list and activate it again so that the new dials are updated.<\/p>\n<p>All this numbering change will take place completely automatically for all users from day 2, <strong>except those who have a satellite decoder<\/strong> (not iPlus).  For these, the change will occur at a later date, although these users have the possibility to do it themselves by following these steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Press<strong> the custom key<\/strong> of command<\/li>\n<li>Select option 5 \u201cChannel memorisation\u201d and press OK<\/li>\n<li>Select option 6 \u00ab<strong>automatic storage<\/strong>\u00bb and press OK<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Movistar is currently preparing for this great change of dials, which will take place from next June 2.
