This new convergent offer from the blue operator arrived a few weeks ago with <strong>a lot of configuration options<\/strong>.  On the occasion of its premiere, Movistar has activated its Super Offer, thanks to which you can get a free device from a long list.  These are all that you can take, but yes, hurry up, the offer ends.<\/p>\n<p>This Super Offer is active for contracts <b>until next May 30<\/b> of the miMovistar modalities, as well as customers who have not yet acquired one of these devices.  If customers come from higher rates they will not be able to enjoy the Super Offer.  The most important thing to keep in mind is that not all modalities have access to the same devices, so just below you will be able to see which ones each of them has access to.<\/p>\n<h2>miMovistar basic<\/h2>\n<p>The most basic version of those offered by the miMovistar package already has enough to offer.  With this, what we are going to take home is <strong>F<\/strong><b>300 MB ibra and a mobile line with 30 GB<\/b> of data to navigate and unlimited calls.  If we get hold of it right now, we will only pay 27.45 euros per month for the first three months, later going on to cost 54.90 euros.  With this entry version to miMovistar, these are the devices that you can take home for free thanks to the Super Offer:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>OPPO A74 5G 128GB<\/li>\n<li>Lenovo Tab K10 LTE 32GB<\/li>\n<li>Xbox Series S<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1686048\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Get a free device with MiMovistar.<\/p>\n<h2>mi Movistar medium<\/h2>\n<p>The intermediate version of miMovistar makes a considerable leap in quality, both in fiber and in the mobile line that is included.  In this case, what we will have available will be a mobile line <b>totally unlimited<\/b> (both data and calls) and <b>1GB fiber optic<\/b>.  The price it has during the first three months is 34.95 euros, later going on to cost 69.90.  Here, as you can imagine, we are going to have more Super Sale devices with some very interesting ones:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>OPPO A74 5G black 128 GB<\/li>\n<li>Samsung Galaxy A52s 5G black 128 GB<\/li>\n<li>Xiaomi 11 Lite 5G NE 128 GB<\/li>\n<li>Xiaomi Mi TV P1 55 inches black<\/li>\n<li>LG Smart TV 43 inches UQ80006LB black<\/li>\n<li>Smart TV 50 inches TCL P615<\/li>\n<li>Toshiba 55-inch Smart TV UA2063DG<\/li>\n<li>Lenovo Tab K10 LTE 32GB Blue<\/li>\n<li>Xiaomi Pad 5 Wifi gray<\/li>\n<li>Lenovo V15 gray 128GB<\/li>\n<li>Lenovo 300e Black Chromebook<\/li>\n<li>Xbox Series S White<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1631112\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1631112\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/9-mobiles-9-Smart-TVs-and-more-for-free.png\" alt=\"My Movistar\" width=\"715\" height=\"481\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1631112\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is the modular offer of miMovistar<\/p>\n<h2>miMovistar advanced<\/h2>\n<p>We arrive at the best that miMovistar has to build on top of the rest of the convergent offer.
