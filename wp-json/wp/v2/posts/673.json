In this case, they will only have <strong>11.5Mbps speed.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For their part, if they live in remote areas without fiber or ADSL, they will have radio access, that is, using their 3G or 4G networks.  Here the speed will rise slightly to 20 Mbps. Without a doubt, the arrival of 5G in these areas will be a good opportunity to improve these conditions.<\/p>\n<h3>Be careful if you exceed the 550 minutes of calls to mobiles<\/h3>\n<p>The miMovistar rates include 550 minutes of calls to mobiles from the landline, being <strong>500 minutes on weekends<\/strong> and 50 minutes on weekdays.

This includes 5GB, which is not bad for a secondary line, but still applies a <strong>fixed cost of 40 cents<\/strong> for each call we make for call establishment.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, we can only share the data in the Max mode and have a common bag of 35 gigabytes.  In case of doing it in unlimited modes, they will automatically lose unlimited data and we will only have 25GB to browse that month.<\/p>\n<h3>Satellite television does not have it all<\/h3>\n<p>In the event that Movistar is forced to install satellite television as it does not have fiber at home, the customer <strong>will lose a number of benefits<\/strong> What:<\/p>\n<p>In the case of satellite TV service provision: Satellite TV does not include U7D (Last Seven Days), recording service or Home Multiaccess with Movistar Plus+ on devices. <\/p>\n<p>In addition, you will have to pay a registration fee:<\/p>\n<p>With the simultaneous contracting of the satellite TV supply service and of any Fusion modality, in the case of customers with fiber coverage, the subscription fee for the satellite TV supply service will be \u20ac75.<\/p>\n<h3>Free device, but depending on where you live<\/h3>\n<p>In the legal conditions it is indicated that the clients will have a free device except those of <strong>Movistar Max<\/strong> in regulated areas.
