The problem is that it is not always easy to learn which distribution best suits our needs, or simply what we can do with them.  For this reason, we have brought you <strong>a compilation of the best Linux websites<\/strong> so that you can learn everything about it and answer any questions you may have.  Of course, they are all in English.<\/p>\n<p>The best page to learn a bit more about Linux is, of course, <strong>the Linux foundation&#8217;s own website<\/strong>.  The page updates its content practically almost daily, and in it we will be able to find tons of information about Linux.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>We have at our disposal a very large list of tutorials, <strong>and even a section to obtain certificates<\/strong>.  These are paid, but they will be useful if at some point we want to dedicate ourselves professionally to the development or use of this open source operating system.<\/p>\n<p>This website is possibly one of the most popular we have to learn more about Linux, and it is focused, as its name indicates, <strong>on ubuntu<\/strong>which is possibly the most popular and long-used Linux distribution.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1624029\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1651830539_885_Best-websites-to-learn-about-Linux-and-answer-questions.jpg\" alt=\"omg ubuntu\" width=\"715\" height=\"358\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>The website also has very up-to-date tutorials, as well as a section where hardware is also discussed.  For users who are just starting out in the world of Linux <strong>and who want an accessible website<\/strong> this OMG!  Ubuntu! is a great option.<\/p>\n<p>An ideal website for those who come to Linux <strong>with practically zero knowledge about it<\/strong>.  This website has not been updated for some time (unlike the previous ones), but it treats the basics much more carefully.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1624065 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1651830539_571_Best-websites-to-learn-about-Linux-and-answer-questions.jpg\" alt=\"the ultimate linux\" width=\"715\" height=\"343\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>The web has inside it a long list of tutorials that go <strong>from the simplest programming to the installation or use of programs of all kinds<\/strong>.  Another one of the first stops you should make to get started on Linux.<\/p>\n<p>LinuxScoop is also a very good starting point for Linux, although in this case it is better that you arrive here with some knowledge in your pocket.  The website is not completely updated, <strong>but it&#8217;s worth it for one simple reason<\/strong>: <strong>its content<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1624077\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1651830539_8_Best-websites-to-learn-about-Linux-and-answer-questions.jpg\" alt=\"linuxscoop\" width=\"715\" height=\"358\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>We not only talk about its content because it is of quality, but in the case of LinuxScoop it is about <strong>a database of tutorials and video explanations<\/strong>.  Very good option to learn more about the operating system without reading.<\/p>\n<p>Ask ubuntu is also heavily focused on this distribution, but with content that is up-to-date.  This is due to the fact that more than a website to use, it is a forum <strong>where users can exchange topics and questions of all kinds<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1624098\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1651830539_250_Best-websites-to-learn-about-Linux-and-answer-questions.jpg\" alt=\"ask ubuntu\" width=\"715\" height=\"337\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Searching this website may be somewhat less clear than in the previous cases, but it will suffice to go to the left side of the screen <strong>and select the Tags option<\/strong> to be able to easily search for content from one topic or several.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This page came to take the witness of LinOxide<\/strong>, and is another very good option for Linux beginners.  It is true that the website has a somewhat &#8220;simple&#8221; interface, but it makes up for it with great content on tutorials.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1624143\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1651830539_647_Best-websites-to-learn-about-Linux-and-answer-questions.jpg\" alt=\"linuxopsys\" width=\"715\" height=\"351\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>For more specific topics, it is better to go to other options on this list, but if we want to get &#8220;to the point&#8221; to take the first steps, LinuxOPsys has everything we need <strong>to start with Linux and be able to do the most basic things with it<\/strong>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As we say, this operating system offers hundreds of possibilities to users, both at home and at a professional level.
