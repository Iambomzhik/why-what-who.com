To do this, the first thing will be to get to know the application thoroughly, to later download it, install it and finally configure it.<\/p>\n<h2>What is FileZilla<\/h2>\n<p>We are talking about a software tool as an FTP client that is one of the most popular options, since it is open source, free and multi-device, which allows us not only to use it on Windows but also on other operating systems such as macOS and Linux.  Through its use allows users <strong>connect to ftp servers<\/strong> to be able to exchange files at high speed.  Also, it not only supports other protocols like FTP with encryption, SFTP and FTPS.<\/p>\n<p>Among its many functions we can highlight the most important:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>site administrator<\/strong>: allows us to create and store a list of FTP servers and associated connection data.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Directory Comparison<\/strong>: Allows a user to compare the contents of a local and remote directory.<\/li>\n<li><strong>File and folder view<\/strong>: Allows the user to modify files and folders and provides the ability to drag and drop items between local and remote directories.<\/li>\n<li><strong>transfer queue<\/strong>: Shows the status of file transfers in progress or waiting to be processed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Additionally, FileZilla Pro is also distributed, which has additional protocol support for WebDAV, Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Microsoft Azure Blob and File Storage and Google Cloud Storage.  Its price is 19.99 euros.<\/p>\n<h2>Free download<\/h2>\n<p>Downloading and installing FileZilla is a quick and simple process, but it&#8217;s always a good idea to follow these steps to make sure everything runs smoothly.  The first thing we have to do is access its official website, and click on the button <strong>Download FileZilla Client<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>This will take us to a new page where it will indicate the latest available version and the recommended version according to our operating system, since it is compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.  Therefore, we click again on the button <strong>Download FileZilla Client<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-725187 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652778568_875_How-to-share-and-download-files-via-FTP-with-FileZilla.jpg\" alt=\"Download Filezilla client\" width=\"920\" height=\"409\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Then a pop-up window will appear for us to choose the edition we want.  In our case, we are going to download the first option, FileZilla, so we click on the button <strong>Download<\/strong> at the bottom for the download to begin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-725193 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652778568_978_How-to-share-and-download-files-via-FTP-with-FileZilla.jpg\" alt=\"Download FileZilla Edition\" width=\"920\" height=\"409\"  \/><\/p>\n<h2>Step by step installation<\/h2>\n<p>Once downloaded we will obtain a file called <strong>FileZilla_3.59.0_win64_sponsored2-setup<\/strong> (in the event that we download the 32-bit version, it will change to win32), we double click on it and the installation wizard will appear as a window, where it will show us the license.

When connecting to a server, we can do it in two main ways, either through a quick connection or by configuring specific connections that we can save later.<\/p>\n<h3>Fast connection<\/h3>\n<p>In the main menu we will have a quick menu at the top to connect to the server.  To do this, it will only be necessary to enter the IP address or the name of the server to which we want to connect in the Server section.  Later we enter the username and password along with the connection port.  Finally, we press the Quick Connect button.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-725214 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652778568_184_How-to-share-and-download-files-via-FTP-with-FileZilla.jpg\" alt=\"FileZilla Quick Connect\" width=\"920\" height=\"124\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Most normal FTP servers use port 21, SFTP servers use port 22, and FTP over TLS (implicit mode) uses port 990 by default.  However, these ports are not required, so it is better to allow outgoing connections to arbitrary remote ports.<\/p>\n<h3>Make Specific Connections<\/h3>\n<p>If what we want is to configure more specific ones that we can store, we must click on the \u201cFile\u201d tab.  This will open a menu where we select the option to <strong>site manager<\/strong>s, where it will be possible to create a folder to save and keep our servers organized.  We can also access it using the keyboard shortcut \u201cCtrl + S\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-725235 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652778568_116_How-to-share-and-download-files-via-FTP-with-FileZilla.jpg\" alt=\"FileZilla site manager\" width=\"920\" height=\"217\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Next, a new window appears where we can use the button <strong>New folder<\/strong> to create a folder where to save the servers and the New site button from where we can create a new connection with a server.  By clicking on the button<strong> new site<\/strong>the menu that we have on the left will be enabled with different tabs to fill in such as General, Advanced, Transfer Options and Character Set.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>General<\/strong>: in this tab we are going to choose the connection protocol (FTP, SFTP, Storj).  Later we enter the data of the server and port, as well as one of the available encryptions.  Next, we select the access mode (Anonymous, Normal, Ask for password, Interactive or Account).  Finally, we select the username and password, as well as a color for the background.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-725220 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652778568_617_How-to-share-and-download-files-via-FTP-with-FileZilla.jpg\" alt=\"FileZilla general site control\" width=\"920\" height=\"406\"  \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced<\/strong>: here the first thing will be to choose the type of server to which we want to connect, which we will leave as Default (Detect automatically).
