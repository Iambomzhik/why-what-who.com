The Minister of the Presidency, F\u00e9lix Bola\u00f1os, confirmed on Monday, May 2, that the phones of the President, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, and the Minister of Defense, Margarita Robles, were infected with the Pegasus espionage program in May and June 2021, respectively.  A few days later it was announced that the Minister of the Interior, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, had also been intervened.<\/p>\n<p>Given this rise in espionage, you may be wondering what you can do to avoid being spied on on the Internet.  It is possible that until now you have not considered <strong>what is fingerprinting and how can you avoid being spied on<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Fingerprinting<\/h2>\n<p>Fingerprinting or fingerprint of the device is a<strong> identification and tracking technique<\/strong> of users through their devices through the systematic collection of information on a certain remote device with the aim of identifying it, singularizing it and, in this way, being able to monitor the activity of the user of the same with the purpose of profiling it.<\/p>\n<p>Entities using fingerprint mechanisms perform a<strong> systematic collection of information<\/strong> of all the terminals that connect to their servers with the objective<br \/>to single them out and be able to track the user&#8217;s browsing to build a profile.<\/p>\n<p> <iframe title=\"como SER AN\u00d3NIMO EN INTERNET - \u00bfQu\u00e9 ES el FINGERPRINTING o HUELLA DIGITAL?\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fak2k-qx48U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe> <\/p>\n<p>Profiling is not limited to collecting and analyzing the user&#8217;s browsing habits or the searches carried out on servers.  The most advanced techniques even allow <strong>record the movements made by the user through the web page with the mouse<\/strong>examining which parts of the screen it lingers on the longest.<\/p>\n<p>When accessing a web page, the browser executes on the user&#8217;s device, and without their knowledge, a series of treatments with the aim of collecting data from it that is sufficiently detailed to be able to individualize it and transmit it to the server that stores it. for later use.<\/p>\n<h2>Protect yourself from the fingerprint<\/h2>\n<p>Keep in mind that your browser shares the information used for fingerprinting with any site automatically, and fingerprinting doesn&#8217;t require you to install anything on your computer or make it do anything weird like a virus or malware would.  However, some have been updated to add solutions against fingerprinting, as in Firefox (since 72.0).<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1622436\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">fingerprint fingerprint<\/p>\n<p>In this way, there are no solutions as simply universal as can happen with the use of an antivirus.  Instead, there are certain <strong>security extensions that can help you fight against fingerprints<\/strong>.  Some aim to anonymize various features used for fingerprinting, while others attempt to block related tracking techniques and sites known to spy on their visitors.<\/p>\n<p>Two good options to consider here are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>uBlock Origin<\/strong>: Product available for Chrome, Firefox, and other popular open source publicly licensed (GPLv3) browsers that collects lists of anti-tracking filters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-to-stop-being-spied-on-online.com\/webstore\/detail\/ublock-origin\/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm&#038;chs=200x200&#038;chld=L|0.png\" alt=\"uBlock Origin\"\/>  <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-to-stop-being-spied-on-online.jpeg\" alt=\"uBlock Origin\"\/>      <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-to-stop-being-spied-on-online.org\/es\/firefox\/addon\/ublock-origin\/&#038;chs=200x200&#038;chld=L|0.png\" alt=\"uBlock Origin\"\/>  <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-to-stop-being-spied-on-online.png\" alt=\"uBlock Origin\"\/>     <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Privacy Badger:<\/strong> a browser extension that automatically learns to block invisible trackers, as well as to locate some kinds of fingerprints.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-to-stop-being-spied-on-online.com\/webstore\/detail\/privacy-badger\/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp&#038;chs=200x200&#038;chld=L|0.png\" alt=\"Privacy Badger\"\/>  <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653213670_870_how-to-stop-being-spied-on-online.jpeg\" alt=\"Privacy Badger\"\/>      <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-to-stop-being-spied-on-online.org\/es\/firefox\/addon\/privacy-badger17\/&#038;chs=200x200&#038;chld=L|0.png\" alt=\"Privacy Badger\"\/>  <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653213670_356_how-to-stop-being-spied-on-online.png\" alt=\"Privacy Badger\"\/>     <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Espionage is being one of the fashionable topics in the news today.
