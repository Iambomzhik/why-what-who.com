Even if you continue to keep Google as your default Internet search engine, do not lose sight of the following alternatives.<\/p>\n<p>When we access a search engine, we always do it for our own benefit, either because we need some information or to know a place to download files, for example.  With Ecosia, in addition to this, we will also be doing <strong>a very good deed if we use it<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>80% of the revenue Ecosia generates through advertising goes entirely to <strong>to plant trees in some countries<\/strong> like Madagascar or Peru.

If you want to take a cable to the environment while searching the Internet, always use Ecosia.<\/p>\n<p>As we have said a little above, Google is the number one option (and number two too) of practically everyone.  That&#8217;s because their algorithms work great to find anything on the internet, <strong>but it may be that if we want to look for something very specific, it is better to go to an alternative<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1685439\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653760309_731_7-websites-to-search-the-Internet-without-depending-on-Google.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"358\"  \/><strong>GIFs, emojis and others<\/strong> they have become very popular in recent years, and although you can of course Google them, it will take much less <strong>if you do it with Giphy<\/strong>.  This website is great to search for what we want from this type of content, and it is practically impossible for you not to find what you are looking for.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, what a search engine should do is show us results of all kinds that fit our search parameters.  The less restrictions a search engine has, the better it will always be. <strong>except in Kiddle&#8217;s case<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1685457\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653760309_40_7-websites-to-search-the-Internet-without-depending-on-Google.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"355\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>This search engine is designed to be used by the smallest of the house and who want to satisfy their curiosity.  Kiddle&#8217;s algorithms will avoid displaying those results <strong>that<\/strong> <strong>are not age appropriate<\/strong>and also its interface is more fun than Google&#8217;s, which is undoubtedly a claim for them.<\/p>\n<p>If what you want is to learn English (or improve your level), Ludwig can come in handy.  It is a search engine in the purest style of Google Translate, since what we will have to enter will be <strong>approximate phrases of what we want to search for<\/strong>even if we don&#8217;t know how to write them correctly.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1685523\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653760309_118_7-websites-to-search-the-Internet-without-depending-on-Google.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"357\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Ludwig will search for similar phrases in the most reliable sources, where even <strong>The New York Times, the BBC or The Guardian<\/strong>, just to give a few examples.

Using it is the simplest, and once you do it you will not go to another site to look for information of this type.<\/p>\n<p>If, for example, we are looking for information to do a job, the most common thing is to go to Google.  This search engine will give us above all contrasted results from articles or scientific journals, <strong>Leaving aside some posts that you consider to be &#8220;unreliable&#8221;<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1685622\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653760309_728_7-websites-to-search-the-Internet-without-depending-on-Google.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"337\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>This is precisely where Boardreader comes in.

Of course, this information may not be as reliable, although it is worth taking it into account.<\/p>\n<p>We have left one of the best alternatives to Google for last if what worries you about this is the privacy of your data. <strong>Peekier does not record any personal information<\/strong> nor does it track our activity while we use it, something that we cannot say about other search engines.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1685625\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653760309_675_7-websites-to-search-the-Internet-without-depending-on-Google.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"353\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Its interface is very simple, but practical.
