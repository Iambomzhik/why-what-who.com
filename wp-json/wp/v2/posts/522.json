However, we must bear in mind that without these software elements the PC would not be able to communicate with the connected components.  A good way to manage all these elements is with the program <strong>IObit Driver Booster<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>It is no longer just about installing the corresponding and most suitable <strong>controllers<\/strong> for each hardware element of the PC.  Also, for everything to work as it should, we need to keep these items updated to their latest version.  As with the rest of the software because it is part of our team, updates are key here.  They are usually provided by the manufacturer of that component to add new functions and patch possible vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, these controllers that we are talking about try to increase and <strong>improve hardware performance<\/strong> to which it refers.  It is true that Windows offers us a series of generic drivers that will help us in certain circumstances.  But it is recommended that we install and use the <strong>original manufacturers<\/strong>.  In order to get rid of the management and maintenance of these small pieces of software, programs like IObit Driver Booster are very useful to us.<\/p>\n<p>This specific title is responsible for scanning our computer and automatically updating the drivers that need it.  On many occasions, the application itself uses the official websites to <strong>update our drivers in the best way<\/strong>.  Also, the software integrates a huge database to be more effective in its task.  All this will help us to ignore the updates of these elements while we have the most recent versions of the drivers.<\/p>\n<h2>Why PC is slow after updating with IObit Driver Booster<\/h2>\n<p>However, and with the use of this application that we are telling you about from the developer IObit, some users sometimes encounter some problems.  Specifically, it may be the case that we notice an important <strong>overall performance drop on PC<\/strong> after using this app.  How could it be otherwise, this problem will not please the majority.  However, from here we will tell you that the developer of the program tells us that it is normal.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>The first thing we need to know is that we are working with very widespread and sensitive components that are part of the operating system.  Therefore, when handling <strong>this can affect all Windows<\/strong> and part of the installed elements.  This drop in performance to which we refer is reflected on the IObit Driver Booster website.  The main reason for this is that the failure, to call it in some way, is more common than we could imagine.<\/p>\n<p>The explanation for all this is that when <strong>start the computer after updating the drivers<\/strong> for the first time with this program, <strong>the system has to load the new drivers<\/strong>.  This is something that consumes a lot of resources.  Therefore, we will notice a significant drop in performance, so it will be slower.  To solve this, we just have to restart again later, when the process is finished.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On many occasions we do not give due importance to the controllers or drivers that are part of our computer.
