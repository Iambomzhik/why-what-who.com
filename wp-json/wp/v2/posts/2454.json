There are many programs with these characteristics that are sure to be more than familiar to you.  Among the known clients here we can mention <strong>uTorrent<\/strong>, <strong>qBittorrent<\/strong>, <strong>BitTorrent<\/strong> and many more.  While the main objective of all these programs is the same, we found some significant differences in their configuration and operation.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, users have the possibility and freedom to choose the one that most interests them in each case.  However, whatever you decide, there are certain elements and terms to consider when working with Torrent files and P2P networks.  Here we are going to talk about two basic elements in this type of download so that you can clearly distinguish them.  And it is necessary to take into consideration that the secret of the proper functioning of the aforementioned clients lies in certain components.<\/p>\n<p>Serve as a clear example of all this both the <strong>trackers<\/strong> like the <strong>seeds<\/strong> that we have at that moment <strong>download content<\/strong>.  First of all, you may be interested to know that these types of downloads are the most appropriate when it comes to sharing files, they will leave size.  Thanks to their morphology and mode of operation, these networks are perfect for these specific downloads and <strong>reduce the possibility of errors and packet loss<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>Importance of trackers and seeds in Torrent<\/h2>\n<p>We could say that the <strong>P2P networks<\/strong> They are made up of users who serve as nodes with their teams and who share content with the rest.  In this way, the aforementioned clients connect to all those nodes to get hold of those Torrent files that we have previously loaded to download the desired contents.  Let&#8217;s leave aside the association of Torrents with piracy, since these files go much further and are not at all related to illegal practices.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously here what we are looking for is, among other things, the speed of downloads, where both the mentioned seeds and trackers play a fundamental role.  The first thing we must be clear about is that the trackers used by these clients are <strong>special servers that contain the necessary information<\/strong> for the seeds to connect with each other.  In this way they enable communication, all using the BitTorrent protocol in content sharing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>It could be said that they are a meeting point used by clients to be able to communicate and start the <strong>Torrent upload and download<\/strong>.  But on the other hand, so-called seeds also play a very important role here.  In fact, these are fundamental if we want to download, and also download quickly, the Torrents that interest us.  When speaking of these elements we refer to the people or <strong>computers that are currently sharing the torrent file<\/strong> that we&#8217;re going down<\/p>\n<p>Hence the importance that the set of nodes or users share these Torrent over time.  So others can access those contents later.  Obviously, the greater the number of available seeds, the more possibilities we have to download the content quickly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For this type of process, it is specifically downloaded instead of the usual browser, on our computer we install a Torrent client that provides us with what we need.
