In other words, it will not tell us the password that we used, but it will give us the necessary means so that, once we are sure that we are the owners of the account, we can reset it by creating a new password instead of the previous one.<\/p>\n<h2>Common mistakes and advice if we lose the password<\/h2>\n<p>If we are sure that our password is correct but the system tells us that it does not correspond to the one we used to create our account, it is important that we take into account a couple of common errors that usually happen to us when entering the password.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>misspelled email<\/strong>: There are occasions where we certainly typed the password correctly, but we have typed the email address wrong.  That is why the system tells us that the password is not correct because it does not correspond to the email, having been written incorrectly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Caps lock enabled<\/strong>: Another common mistake in these cases is that we have the caps lock key enabled.  It is possible that writing all the letters in uppercase when we think they are in lowercase.  As the system differentiates between uppercase and lowercase letters, we are typing the password incorrectly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Before worrying about recovering the Hotmail password that we have lost or forgotten, we must take into account some tips that we must take into account:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We must ensure that the account has not been inactive for more than 365 days, because in case we have not accessed it in more than a year it will be deleted.<\/li>\n<li>We can deactivate the account and we will only have 30 days to change our mind.  The account and password will be deleted after that time and we can prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.<\/li>\n<li>For faster password reset we need to make sure we provide a current alternate email address and mobile phone number on our account.<\/li>\n<li>We should not log in from a PC that we do not trust.  It may have been infected with malware and viruses that are capable of stealing our Hotmail password and gaining unauthorized access to our Hotmail account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Reset a password in Outlook or Hotmail<\/h2>\n<p>To be able to reset the password that we used in our Outlook or Hotmail account, we can carry it out in two different ways depending on whether or not we have a recovery phone or email.  We simply have to follow the instructions to verify our identity and obtain a new email password.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing we are going to do is access the Outlook web in our preferred browser and click on the button <strong>Log in<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>On the next page we enter <strong>our hotmail email<\/strong> and click Next.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-729954 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653558739_850_Recover-password-and-sign-back-in-to-Outlook-or-Hotmail.jpg\" alt=\"Outlook sign in with email\" width=\"920\" height=\"409\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Now, since we do not remember the password, we must click on the <strong>Forgot your password?<\/strong>, which appears just below the password box.

Now we must complete the hidden part of the email address or write the last four digits of our mobile number, depending on the recovery option we have chosen.

Once this is done, a new screen appears where we will be able to<strong> Reset your password<\/strong> for our account.  We will not be able to use the one we previously had, so we must enter a new one of at least 8 characters and distinguish between upper and lower case.
