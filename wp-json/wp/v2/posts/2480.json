When we decide to buy one, as a general rule, it is to be with it for a good many years, something for which opting for a high-end model is great.  These have, of course, a fairly high price tag, but if we are vigilant we can take advantage of a great offer from time to time.  If you were looking for one of them, you have come to the right place: <strong>this LG is at an unbeatable price<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LG has been making high-quality OLED Smart TVs for several years now<\/strong>, ideal both for viewing multimedia content and for playing with consoles.  This particular model is ideal for playing with the latest consoles that have hit the market, as we will see later.<\/p>\n<h2>A slim and very elegant design<\/h2>\n<p>This LG model is from last year, but make no mistake: <strong>continues to offer a quality that has very few rivals<\/strong>.  This 55-inch C1 has a design very much in line with the rest of LG&#8217;s high-end televisions, so we can expect an almost non-existent frame (we will enjoy 95% of the screen) and a very thin thickness, especially on the part top where it is even thinner.  This by the way is quite large, so our TV will have almost perfect stability.<\/p>\n<p>The OLED panel of this C1 is simply spectacular, and <strong>it will show us a great sharpness in the colors<\/strong>.  Blacks, which is the key point of OLED televisions, are very pure and have an outstanding level.  Obviously, we can expect from it all the latest image technologies on the market, such as HDR10 Pro, HDR Dolby Vision IQ or HLG Pro. Something that is very interesting about this line of televisions is that it has <strong>an environmental sensor<\/strong> that captures sunlight to adapt image quality or image settings.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>If we continue talking a little about what this LG is capable of, we cannot ignore its operating system.  This comes standard with WebOS 6, a system that is simple, but full of features.  We will have no problem using the most popular applications such as Netflix or YouTube.  The controller also has <strong>a kind of pointer that will help us move around it<\/strong>which makes handling much more comfortable.<\/p>\n<h2>Ideal for enjoying video games<\/h2>\n<p>Thanks to the level of quality of its panel, this 55-inch LG C1 is great for watching movies and series, but it is even better for playing games.  It has HDMI 2.1 ports, which are essential if we want to play with PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X at 4K and 120 fps.  Not only that, but it also has <strong>Nvidia G Sync<\/strong> Y <strong>AMD Free Sync<\/strong>two systems that will make the image much smoother and that we will not suffer cuts or delays of any kind.<\/p>\n<p>The standard sound of this television makes it unnecessary to go to an external system.  It has <strong>a power of 40W<\/strong> which is more than enough for a large room, and it also has AI processing and Dolby Atmos to enhance its quality.  In terms of connectivity, this LG has support for dual band (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), Bluetooth 5.0 and has <strong>integrated Miracast and Air Play 2<\/strong>.  It is also compatible with Alexa and the Google Voice Assistant.<\/p>\n<p>As a general rule, this LG C1 has a fairly high price (specifically 1,899 euros), but thanks to this offer from El Corte Ingl\u00e9s <strong>you can get her for 999 euros<\/strong>a discount of almost 50%.<\/p>\n<p>The articles listed contain an affiliate link that reports to ADSLZone a small commission for each purchase.
