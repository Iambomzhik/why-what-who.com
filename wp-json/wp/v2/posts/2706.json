We can say that luckily I got an offer in which the phone came with a charger, but the 25w one, much to be desired from this company.  Currently, I think they should improve face recognition, since Apple completely eats up Samsung in this area.  In addition, the fingerprint recognition leaves something to be desired, since when you put on a protector it does not work correctly, they should look for another area\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Sergio also talks about a &#8220;bittersweet feeling&#8221; with the Samsung mobile in a comment in March 2022 on the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra website.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cI have bittersweet feelings, it goes very well and is a great high-end, but it has little things that do not leave me completely satisfied for the price of \u20ac1,350.  the fingerprint is slow compared to other brands, if you put a protector on it, forget that you don&#8217;t have to apply your finger more than twice to be recognized.  I notice a lack of coverage at times and on the internet it sometimes gets a bit stuck, having to close the window since <strong>does not let go forward or backwards<\/strong>.  The screen is very good but the color of the icons of the applications themselves are not very bright, the truth is that it leaves me somewhat dissatisfied for the price paid but I have a couple of returns from other mobiles and I don&#8217;t know if Amazon might not like a new change .  It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;m satisfied with the high-end prices for what they really give.  It may be because of its exynos processor and that with the 8 gen 1 it goes much better, I don&#8217;t know, but it&#8217;s not something huge either, it&#8217;s a very expensive phone for what it claims to give and then it really gives.
