But, how can we install it at home?<\/p>\n<h2>Movistar&#8217;s Smart WiFi 6, an improved router<\/h2>\n<p>And it is that last October, when the existence of this new Movistar router model was known, what we saw is that it was an update of the current device.  An evolution of the same that forced the operator to have an intermediate team that improves performance.<\/p>\n<p>And so it has been.  Thus, with this Movistar Smart Wifi 6, we have a new team that goes deeper to improve connectivity in your Movistar Home with a speed up to <strong>five times higher<\/strong> and up to 30% more coverage thanks to this new technology.<\/p>\n<p>In this way, it allows it to behave in two ways: either as an access point designed to <strong>provide us with WiFi 6 connectivity<\/strong> and replace the WiFi network served by the router, or it can be used as a signal repeater that works side by side with the router to expand the coverage of our network.
