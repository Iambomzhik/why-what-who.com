Although it can also be used to download videos, the platform has an option that allows <strong>download music from YouTube.com in MP3 format<\/strong>without the need to perform any conversion afterwards. <\/p>\n<p>Of course, it does not require installing any program, and the whole process is done from the browser.<\/p>\n<p>      <img class=\"b-lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652629345_157_How-to-download-music-from-YouTube-and-free-songs-without.jpg\" alt=\"sports headphones\"\/><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"embed-article-title\">\n<p>      These are the best sports headphones of 2021<\/p>\n<\/h3>\n<p>You can use the service both from your computer and from your mobile, so if you wish you have the possibility of saving the file directly on your smartphone to play it locally.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of the device you use, the procedure to follow to download a song using this web page is as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to ClipConverter.cc page.<\/li>\n<li>Then, in the box that has the title <strong>Multimedia Direction<\/strong>paste the URL of the YouTube video that we want to download in MP3 format. <\/li>\n<li>Next, click on the button <strong>Continue<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Once the verification is finished, in the <strong>Conversion Format<\/strong>: click on the option <strong>MP3<\/strong>.  Then, ignore the rest of the settings and click on the button <strong>Continue<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>At the moment in which the video has finished converting, you only have to click on the button <strong>Download<\/strong> to download the audio file of the video that you entered in the first step.<\/li>\n<li>What we can do is choose the quality of the resulting audio.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">online video converter<\/h2>\n<p>Aesthetically it is not the page for <strong>download an mp3 from youtube<\/strong> The most beautiful, nor the one with the least publicity, but on the other hand, it is one of the most complete, since in addition to being able to download songs from YouTube without programs, it allows you to do the same with Facebook, Vimeo, Dailymotion and many other services.<\/p>\n<p>It is also one of the few <strong>pages to download the audio of a YouTube video<\/strong> that allows you to select the quality of the resulting audio, and convert a specific section of it by selecting the exact minute of the beginning of the conversion and the end.<\/p>\n<p>These are the steps you have to take to convert a song or the audio of a YouTube video into MP3 with this website:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, we enter the Onlinevideoconverter website<\/li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Convert a video link<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>We paste the link of the YouTube video that we want to download in the box at the top, where it says Enter a URL, for example&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Display the list just below and select the audio format you want.

We have a good number of options, although what really interests us is <strong>convert to mp3<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We entered FLVTO.<\/li>\n<li>we just have to <strong>copy the url<\/strong> of the YouTube video in the part of the website dedicated to it.<\/li>\n<li>Now it&#8217;s time to press on <strong>Convert<\/strong> so that when the option comes out <strong>Download<\/strong> let&#8217;s click on it and so the file is saved in our internal storage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Save To MP3<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Another good website where we can download the music from any video <\/strong>from YouTube is Save To MP3.  It is a secure website with an interface that is quite improvable, but very effective. <\/p>\n<p>The lack of an attractive interface makes up for it by being one of the <strong>faster websites<\/strong> as far as the transformation process from one format to another is concerned.  We must do the following to work with it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We open Save To MP3.<\/li>\n<li>Now we click on <strong>Search for a video<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Automatically it is shown to us in the <strong>top of screen <\/strong>the area where we must write the name of the YouTube video. <\/li>\n<li>Then we press the <strong>Enter <\/strong>of our keyboard.<\/li>\n<li>At that moment we will see below the advertising, the thumbnail of the video and two download options <strong>Download MP4<\/strong> Y <strong>Download MP3<\/strong>,<strong> <\/strong>which we must press.<\/li>\n<li>The MP3 file will automatically save where we have preconfigured downloads to be saved.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">freemake<\/h2>\n<p>Although it may be that some of you know the Freemaker applications such as Video Converter and Video Downloader, the truth is that the web is<strong> one of the best and fastest <\/strong>to download the audio of a YouTube video.<\/p>\n<p>The trick on this website is not to succumb to the number of times they offer you to install their application, because if you manage to do this, you will be able to have the sound of any video extremely quickly.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We open the Freemake download website.<\/li>\n<li>Later we will see how we have a place where we can <strong>write the url<\/strong> of the YouTube video, action that we are going to carry out.<\/li>\n<li>Once we see that it has been loaded at the bottom, we choose the format in which we want to download it, in our case being <strong>MP3<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Then we click on <strong>download now<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>It will take us to a black web where we can listen to the audio of the video.
