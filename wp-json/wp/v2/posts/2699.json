They are already part of the decoration of any home and any building or office.  But just because it is there and we use it daily does not mean that we know it completely.  For example, and although not all homes have it, there is the <strong>known as WiFi Plus network<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As such, this is a network that we can connect to that has the same name as the common one, the &#8216;normal network&#8217;, but has the word &#8216;Plus&#8217; added to the end.  This is a provision that Movistar users have, above all, who implemented this alternative a few years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Those who have used it will have verified that the signal can be given <strong>in two ways<\/strong> hand in hand with the same router.  In fact, as we say, the WiFi network is almost identical between the two, but its differences are implicit in two speeds and its coverage: the one we have previously chosen and another, the Plus, which generally has a <strong>larger amplitude<\/strong>.  But then, is this better than the normal one?<\/p>\n<h2>Offers higher speed but less coverage<\/h2>\n<p>But let&#8217;s go by parts.  The WiFi Plus network service allows wireless access to the Internet network and the connection between computers located within the same home.  This is done through the use of a WiFi modem to which computers and other everyday devices can be connected.<\/p>\n<p>Yes indeed;  provided that they have the appropriate software and hardware to access WiFi networks, which generally do, although not all of them do.  For its part, as can be seen, what Movistar allows is to use both and <strong>choose each one<\/strong> according to our own interests.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>One is the one that has to do with the network <strong>2.4Ghz<\/strong>which is the most stable and <strong>offers more coverage<\/strong>, allowing Internet connection in more distant rooms.  However, as we have mentioned before, WiFi Plus offers higher download and upload speeds than this.<\/p>\n<p>Then there is the 5Ghz, which is the one that corresponds to WiFi Plus.  Unlike the previous one, what it does is offer a <strong>higher speed<\/strong> <strong>but less coverage<\/strong>.  Or what is the same: with it we will have a higher speed the closer we are to the router.  The problem is that it is not available on all devices, so not all users have access to it.<\/p>\n<p>Namely;  You are probably trying to connect to the Movistar Plus WiFi network and your device does not support it because it does not use the appropriate standard to be able to connect to said network, therefore, it will always connect to the other network.  Because it&#8217;s newer, there are fewer devices connected to it, so it&#8217;s supposed to be a<strong> network with less interference<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>Is it better than &#8216;normal&#8217;?<\/h3>\n<p>Which is better?  This is not a one answer question as it depends on the situation.  Yes, it is true that WiFi Plus is faster than WiFi, but it is so at short distances.  As you move away from the router, the speed drops.  And the same happens if you change rooms or there are walls between your connected device and your router.<\/p>\n<p>WiFi is more recommended than WiFi Plus for devices not compatible with WiFi Plus, of course, but also for connected devices <strong>at a certain distance<\/strong> or in other rooms than the one containing the router.<\/p>\n<p>With this, for its part, if you make normal use of the Internet, the 2.4 GHz WiFi network (to which most devices connect) is more than enough, although if you are going to <strong>To play online<\/strong> or make downloads, it is more convenient that you connect to the 5 GHz or the one cataloged as &#8216;+&#8217;.  In the event that a <strong>Usual use<\/strong> navigation, the recommendation is to use the 2.4Ghz network.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The WiFi Plus network and its differences Routers and WiFi connectivity have been with us for a long time.
