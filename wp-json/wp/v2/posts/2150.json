Thus, without going any further, the charge of your battery is <strong>5,000mAh<\/strong>, an amount that will allow you to use it without restrictions and be sure that you will get to the end of the day without problems.  But, if this is not the case, you do not have to worry much because the device has <strong>fast charge<\/strong> using its USB Type-C port.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>In what has to do with the screen, without including one that can be considered as spectacular, it does offer what is necessary for you to enjoy both playing and watching videos on YouTube or the rest of the streaming video platforms.  With dimensions of <strong>6.6 inches<\/strong> and Full HD+ resolution, we are talking about a component that has such interesting additions as a 20:9 ratio and a frequency that reaches <strong>90Hz<\/strong>.  More than enough for the vast majority.<\/p>\n<h2>Your camera does not clash<\/h2>\n<p>You will get photos and videos with a quality that allows you to be satisfied with what you publish on social networks.  This, among other things, is possible thanks to the fact that its main sensor is of <strong>48MP<\/strong> which does not lack PDAF.  And, in addition, it is accompanied by a couple more that help in the wide angle and depth (they are 5 + 2 megapixels, respectively).  In what has to do with the camera for the <strong>selfie<\/strong>the integrated is <strong>8MP<\/strong>which is located in a notch at the top of the screen, and in principle should not give you problems to achieve more than correct portraits.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1671618\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653413858_36_The-Samsung-Galaxy-A22-with-5G-on-offer-at-the.jpg\" alt=\"Rear of the Samsung Galaxy A22 phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>What has been said about the camera and the battery may make you think that the dimensions and weight of this Samsung Galaxy A22 5G will be greater than desirable, but the truth is that this is not the case.  In the first case we speak of <strong>167.2 x 76.4 x 9 millimeters<\/strong>, while in the second just 200 grams.  Therefore, it must be said that a good job has been done to obtain brands that are quite sensible.  An additional detail: this terminal does not lack a fingerprint reader, which is integrated into the power button.<\/p>\n<h2>Is the hardware of this Samsung good?<\/h2>\n<p>Well, without being crazy, the investment of 194 euros that has to be made to buy it now that it is on sale is amortized.  On the one hand, it has an octa-core processor <strong>MediaTek Dimension 700<\/strong> that inside includes a Mali-G57 MC2 GPU, which is perfectly combined with <strong>4GB RAM<\/strong> so that you do not have any problem with the applications that are common, such as WhatsApp or Chrome.  By the way, you will be able to play&#8230; without excesses, but also without problems.<\/p>\n<p>If you add to this that the (expandable) storage is <strong>128GB<\/strong> and that you will achieve a good experience when using WiFi -since the integrated adapter is Dual Band-, it is quite clear that the purchase of this Samsung Galaxy A22 5G is a good option.  You can even <strong>pay with it<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The articles listed contain an affiliate link that reports to ADSLZone a small commission for each purchase.
