Cheat Engine makes single player games easier to play so we always win.  On the other hand, if we feel like a challenge, we can also use it to make games more difficult.  Although cheating may seem a bit ugly, if it is the only way to continue advancing in the game, we are equally interested in this option that we present below.<\/p>\n<h2>What can we do with Cheat Engine<\/h2>\n<p>Cheat Engine is an open source tool whose sole purpose is to help us use cheats and cheats for our favorite video games.  It allows us to be able to manipulate and change all kinds of parameters in them.  We are therefore talking about software that has been specially designed to help us <strong>modify single player games without internet connection<\/strong> so we can make them easier or harder according to our preferences.  Along with this, it contains other useful tools that will help us debug games and even normal applications.<\/p>\n<p>It features a memory scanner to quickly scan the variables used in a game so we can change them.  It also has a debugger, disassembler, assembler, speedhack, direct 3D manipulation tools, system inspection tools, and much more.  It is an especially useful software for programmers and software analysts.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to these tools, it also has extensive scripting support that will allow experienced developers to easily create their own applications and share them with others.<\/p>\n<p>That is why, before using it, we must be clear that it is not an application, much less simple.  As we have mentioned, it is really <strong>intended for programmers, software analyst<\/strong> and in general, any user with advanced knowledge.  Of course, the application has tutorials through which all the steps will be explained to us, even if it is in English.<\/p>\n<p>We must also bear in mind that Cheat Engine will only work with games that we have saved on our PC.  It does not work with online games nor does it work with games that we save in the cloud.  Furthermore, adding mods can also interfere with any patches or updates that the developers release later on for the game, so be very careful and cautious, especially if it&#8217;s a recent game.<\/p>\n<h2>Change parts of a game to make it easier<\/h2>\n<p>Once we run the application we find its main menu and a pop-up window informing us that we can have <strong>access to a tutorial<\/strong> so that we can begin to develop with the software, since, as we have commented, it is not for all audiences.  If we accept, a new window will appear where they will teach you the basic concepts to be able to cheat.  Of course, like the program interface, it is located in <strong>English<\/strong>, so it is important to be able to master it.  In addition, we must add that its design is not exactly attractive or intuitive, which increases its complexity even more, so that the use of the tutorial seems essential.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>By clicking on the icon that represents a PC at the top we select a process to open.  When doing this it is important that the game we want to cheat on is running to choose the game process.  Once the game process is selected, it will be necessary to find the value that we want to modify, be it health, skill points, money and similar values \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bshown in your HUD or character menu are useful for hacking.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-731217 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653398539_993_Modify-games-and-cheat-with-Cheat-Engine.jpg\" alt=\"Cheat Engine interface\" width=\"886\" height=\"917\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>After having chosen the value of the game that we are going to change, we write it in the \u201cValue\u201d field and click on \u201cFirst Scan\u201d to scan first.  The program will search for the game process based on the value we input and display the corresponding data in the list on the left.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-731220 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653398539_771_Modify-games-and-cheat-with-Cheat-Engine.jpg\" alt=\"Cheat Engine process list\" width=\"871\" height=\"889\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>The difficulty of the whole process is marked by the need to<strong> know the values \u200b\u200bthat we are going to change<\/strong> and that are not available to all users.  That is why it is aimed at advanced users or those who want to dedicate many hours of practice until they achieve the desired results.<\/p>\n<h2>Free Download Cheat Engine<\/h2>\n<p>If we want to try Cheat Engine, we must know that it is free and open source software that we will be able to download from the developer&#8217;s website.  The program can be run both on computers with <strong>Windows as macOS<\/strong>.  Its latest available version is 7.4 corresponding to January 20, 2022, so it is an application in constant development and support by its community.  This causes developers to frequently push updates that make the program run smoothly.  Therefore, it is recommended to download each update as they become available.<\/p>\n<p>Its installation is simple because we will only need to execute the file that we downloaded and its assistant will take care of everything.  Of course, we must take into account two important details.  On the one hand, it must be said that during its installation it will try to get us to install <strong>unwanted third party software<\/strong>an ugly practice that we will have to be aware of to omit it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-731208 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653398539_502_Modify-games-and-cheat-with-Cheat-Engine.jpg\" alt=\"Cheat Engine install third party software\" width=\"825\" height=\"626\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Also, some <strong>antivirus software<\/strong> (for example, Windows Defender) mistakenly detect parts of the Cheat Engine like <strong>if it were a virus or trojan<\/strong>, so in this case the installation cannot be completed.  To solve it, it will be necessary to momentarily disable the antivirus for the installation to complete successfully.<\/p>\n<h2>Other alternatives<\/h2>\n<p>If we are looking for software to help us create cheats for the most complicated games, we suggest some alternatives to Cheat Engine to take into account:<\/p>\n<h3>Pitch<\/h3>\n<p>It is a platform capable of managing and administering a trainer that we can activate while we play and that will help us complete parts of the game that are too difficult for us to complete.  It is compatible with more than 2600 PC games.  It is recommended to use it only in offline mode and avoid its use in competitive and multiplayer modes.  It has a free mode, which we can download from its official website and which gives access to a total of 12,200 tricks.  We can also opt for its payment method that has more than 33,600 tricks for more than 2,600 games.<\/p>\n<h3>ArtMoney<\/h3>\n<p>We are talking about a program specially designed to cheat that we can use for all our PC games.  By using it, we can make any troublesome game easier to play and complete.  With it we will be able to change any specific amount of a game, be it money, bullets or health points, so that we have advantages that help us play it.  We can download ArtMoney for free from its website.
