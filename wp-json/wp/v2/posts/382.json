However, they rotate and you can&#8217;t always get <strong>fiber optic at the best price<\/strong> for having let a few days go by.  Right now there are great promotions in both Movistar and Orange or Vodafone.  If you plan to get a high-speed connection at the best price, you should hurry up.<\/p>\n<p>These are right now the best rates of three of the four major operators within the <strong>cheap fiber rate war<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>Movistar fiber promotion without permanence<\/h2>\n<p>The absence of permanence is one of the best benefits associated with a promotional discount.  After all, you have the freedom to change companies if you so decide, looking for new promotional prices or any other type of bonus.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1589763\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fiber 300 Mbps Movistar<\/p>\n<p>Movistar is currently promoting its Movistar Connect with Fiber 300 Mbps rate without permanence at a monthly price of <strong>24 euros per month<\/strong> instead of 38 euros per month, which means a 35% discount for 12 months.  This offer ends in a couple of days, until May 12, so you should run if you want to hire it.  To do this, you can call 900 410 329 from Monday to Sunday from 09:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. or contact them through their web form.<\/p>\n<p>It is a connection of<strong> symmetric fiber optic<\/strong>, although they would also install ADSL or Internet Radio if you don&#8217;t have fiber coverage (at 20 MB).  Includes landline with unlimited calls to national landlines and without schedules, landline fee included and free Smart WiFi router with fiber installation included.  Previously it ended on April 23, 2022 and was extended, so it might not be the definitive end of the promotion, although if you are interested it would be best to hurry up just in case.<\/p>\n<h2>Vodafone 300 Mbps for 22.99 euros per month<\/h2>\n<p>Vodafone has also lowered the 300 Mbps Symmetric Fiber subject to geographical availability since April 20.  In this case it has a 25% discount, so it will not cost 30.99 euros per month, but <strong>22.99 euros per month<\/strong>.  Of course, this time there will be a stay of 12 months, which will be the duration of this discounted price, so you could leave when the price returns to its original amount.  In the event that the service is unsubscribed within the first 12 months of installation, Vodafone will charge the customer a cost of 150 euros.<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1645134\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1645134\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652287928_257_Last-days-of-cheap-fiber-less-than-25-euros-from.jpg\" alt=\"Fiber 300 Mbps Vodafone\" width=\"715\" height=\"349\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1645134\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fiber 300 Mbps Vodafone<\/p>\n<p>This offer is valid for contracting the Vodafone Fibra 300 Mbps rate for new customers (new registrations and portability) until May 31, 2022. In addition to Internet, they will install a landline with which you can make unlimited calls to national landlines and mobiles .<\/p>\n<h2>Orange 500 Mbps Fiber Promotion<\/h2>\n<p>If you are thinking of a little more speed, Orange has Fiber 500 Mbps in its catalog of promotions and, on top of that, at an even lower price than its competitors.  In this case we speak of a price of <strong>\u20ac21.95 per month<\/strong> for 12 months (instead of 30.95 euros per month).<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1645143\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1645143\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652287928_458_Last-days-of-cheap-fiber-less-than-25-euros-from.jpg\" alt=\"Fiber 500 Mbps Orange\" width=\"715\" height=\"349\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1645143\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fiber 500 Mbps Orange<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the Internet connection, you also have unlimited calls to national landlines and 1,000 min (during LV hours 20:00 \u2013 08:00 and weekends 24 hours) to national mobiles.  It also includes a Wi-Fi 6 router.<\/p>\n<p>You also have a 12-month stay that coincides with the promotional price, so you would not have to pay the later price if you unsubscribe at the same time the promotion ends.  The promotion is valid for customers who contract exclusively through Orange&#8217;s official online channel from May 3, 2022 to May 31, 2022 as a new subscription or portability in direct fiber or indirect fiber coverage with VULA technology.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The main national operators usually have promotions almost all year round.
