It is possible that in order to take full advantage of DeviantArt we will have to spend a little time learning how to use it, but it is certainly a great option.<\/p>\n<p>It only takes a few seconds inside Pencil Madness for us to realize that it is an ideal website for drawing lovers.  This website allows us to do <strong>sketches and drawings of all kinds<\/strong>in addition to doing it for free and without even needing to register.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>One of the best things about this portal is that it gives us access to a multitude of drawings made by other users (<strong>some are true works of art<\/strong>), which will allow us to take a look at some of them to get references.<\/p>\n<p>Sketchpad is an essential website if we talk about pages to draw and paint.  Of those that you will find on this list, it is possibly the one that offers the best relationship between <strong>variety of tools and cleanliness in its interface<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1667169\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653041382_166_Have-a-good-time-drawing-and-painting-with-these-free.jpg\" alt=\"sketch pad\" width=\"715\" height=\"356\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>When it comes to drawing, Sketchpad will allow us to use a lot of different drawing styles, and of course we will also have the possibility to combine them at will.  When we finish our small work of art we will also have the possibility of exporting it in a good number of formats, <strong>even in .SVG<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>With Coloring-Online we are going to take a leap in another direction, since it is a drawing website for children that will delight the little ones at home.  The page has <strong>a good number of different sheets<\/strong> that allow to be colored with a very varied color palette.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1667172\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653041382_984_Have-a-good-time-drawing-and-painting-with-these-free.jpg\" alt=\"online coloring\" width=\"715\" height=\"355\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>These sheets enjoy very good quality, and are not the typical ones that we can find in other places.  Once the drawing is finished, <strong>we can print it if we want<\/strong> to save the drawings or place them wherever we want.<\/p>\n<p>Drawing and painting is already a lot of fun, but it&#8217;s also <strong>we have the possibility to do it playing<\/strong>.  The operation of Quick, Draw!  It&#8217;s quite simple: we will have a limited time to draw a drawing of our choice, and the web algorithm will have to try to guess it as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1667175\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653041382_201_Have-a-good-time-drawing-and-painting-with-these-free.jpg\" alt=\"quick draw\" width=\"715\" height=\"355\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>With Quick, Draw!  we can improve our speed and the quality of our drawings, as well as having a good time while.  The algorithm on which the web is based works very well, and most of the time it will be able to guess what we are drawing <strong>even long before we&#8217;re done<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>We are going to close the list with a website that has gained a lot of popularity in recent months thanks mainly to the community of Twitch streamers.  Gartic Phone is a version of the popular children&#8217;s game &#8220;Decomposed Phone&#8221; or &#8220;Cracked Phone&#8221;, <strong>but adapted to the drawing<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1667178\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653041382_99_Have-a-good-time-drawing-and-painting-with-these-free.jpg\" alt=\"gartic phone\" width=\"715\" height=\"354\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>With this free website we can have a great time with friends drawing all kinds of crazy things.  When creating a room, each of the players must <strong>choose something to draw<\/strong>.  This theme will not be for us, but we will have to draw one chosen by another player.  In this way, each game is different from the previous one, and although the drawing tools that the page provides are quite simple, it is impossible not to have fun with Gartic Phone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The web allows us to work on different layers like other editing and drawing programs do, as well as a lower panel packed with different tools so that we can change with just a click of the mouse.
