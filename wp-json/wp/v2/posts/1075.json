There are more and more options that we have within the operators that allow us to enjoy unlimited calls so that we do not have to be attentive to our consumption, or if we have already spent the minutes that we have contracted.  The problem is that the word unlimited can harbor some doubt, and that is that there are some operators, as is the case of Digi, that hides <strong>some limitation for unlimited calls<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>These types of limitations are really nothing new, and there are more operators in the market that also have some limits on their rates with unlimited calls (more on that later).  It is important that we are attentive to these types of limits, <strong>although sometimes it is difficult to find them<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>A \u201chidden\u201d calling limit<\/h2>\n<p>The Romanian operator currently has for its mobile offer <strong>five different rates with unlimited calls<\/strong>.  Obviously, the difference that we can find between the five is in the amount of available data that each one has, being 10, 20, 50, 100 and unlimited data.  All these rates have quite attractive prices, and they have the incentive that they can be enjoyed without problems both in Spain and in Romania.<\/p>\n<p>If we take a look at the additional information that is in each of these unlimited rates, we can read that in these unlimited calls we have included all those that are directed to mobile phones and landlines in Spain, without further information.  Digi also has other types of rates within what is called <strong>&#8220;DigiCombo&#8221;<\/strong> that do not have unlimited calls, but these <strong>include international calls<\/strong> to a fairly large list of countries.<\/p>\n<p>   <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1668102\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Digi unlimited calling rates.<\/p>\n<p>So where can we check if Digi Unlimited Calling has any kind of cap?  To do this, it is necessary to go to the document that collects all the legal conditions of the rates of the Romanian operator.  This document can be consulted on the operator&#8217;s own website, and in it we can see two limitations where one stands out (since the other is not very clear): <strong>we will only be able to call 150 phone numbers per month<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[\u2026]  Unreasonable use is also considered to be (i) use that is significantly above the average use of the Services, for example, use that exceeds <strong>30 times the average consumption of minutes<\/strong> each month for an end customer or a use that exceeds <strong>the 150 different phone numbers<\/strong> in the same month.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Digi isn&#8217;t the only one with limits to her unlimited<\/h2>\n<p>As we have told you earlier in this article, Digi is not the only operator with some limit for its unlimited calls.  These limits imposed by the operators are always of two types:<strong> a minute restriction<\/strong> either <strong>in the number of telephones that we can call per month<\/strong>.  We must not fall into the mistake that we are only going to find these types of limitations in MVNOs, since some of the main operators in our country have them.<\/p>\n<p>Below we leave you with a table where you can see the limits for some of the most important operators in our country:<\/p>\n<table id=\"tablepress-481\" class=\"tablepress table-block block-collapse-amp tablepress-id-481\">\n<tr class=\"row-1 odd\">\n<th class=\"column-1\">Operator<\/th>\n<th class=\"column-2\">Limit for unlimited calls<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tbody class=\"row-hover\">\n<tr class=\"row-2 even\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">Movistar<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">Unlimited<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3 odd\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">Vodafone<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">Unlimited<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-4 even\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">Orange<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">200 numbers per month<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-5 odd\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">Yoigo<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">5,000 minutes per month<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-6 even\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">simyo<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">150 numbers per month<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-7 odd\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">MoreMobile<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">Unlimited<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-8 even\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">Pepephone<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">Unlimited<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-9 odd\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">lowi<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">Unlimited<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-10 even\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">O2<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">Unlimited<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mobile rates have been evolving in recent years.
