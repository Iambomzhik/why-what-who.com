And a clear example of what we say is the Samsung 50Q68A, a device that has an operating system <strong>Tizen<\/strong> so you can install all the applications of streaming video platforms.  In addition, it has a spectacular design due to the fact that its frames are very small \u2013 in this it also helps a lot that its dimensions are only <strong>1,118.3 x 683.6 x 228.8 millimeters<\/strong>including its legs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>In order to evaluate the aforementioned adequately, it must be indicated that the screen that you will find on this Smart TV is of <strong>50 inches<\/strong>, dimensions that fit perfectly to fully enjoy games, sports and movies at home.  Some of the reasons that exist to say this about this equipment is that it has a resolution <strong>4K<\/strong>, so you will get the most out of what can be seen on services such as Netflix or Amazon Prime Video.  In addition, it also has a panel <strong>QLED<\/strong> which allows the brightness to be used to be very high while being combined with an excellent range of colors (which makes it compatible with HDR10 + high dynamic range).<\/p>\n<h2>Many connections and of all kinds<\/h2>\n<p>This section is quite important, and sometimes it is not given due attention.  If the device that is purchased does not comply, in the end you will have more than one headache when it comes to connecting accessories or accessing the Internet.  The fact is that the TV we are talking about <strong>complies perfectly<\/strong> here because, for example, so that you can have everything from your console to a sound bar always available and without having to carry cables in your hand, you will find the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Three HDMI 2.0 ports (ARC compatible)<\/li>\n<li>Optical digital audio output<\/li>\n<li>Two USB connections that allow the connection of external drives with multimedia content or can be used to record live broadcasts.<\/li>\n<li>DVB-T2CS2 antenna tuner<\/li>\n<li>Bluetooth<\/li>\n<li>CI+ port<\/li>\n<li>Component video input<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1689039\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653770949_866_QLED-screen-and-50-inches-this-Samsung-TV-now-at.jpg\" alt=\"Side of the Smart TV Samsung 50Q68A\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not bad at all, everything must be said.  But there is more: when it comes to connections to access the Internet, you will find both <strong>Wi-Fi Dual Band<\/strong> as an Ethernet port, so you will always find the option you need to get the best possible user experience to enjoy content in the cloud.  This television is very complete and now has a discount of 120 euros on Amazon.<\/p>\n<h2>More important things about this Samsung<\/h2>\n<p>One that is currently essential is that it is possible to use the <strong>voice assistants<\/strong> most common with this Samsung 50Q68A.  Thus, you will not have problems with Google&#8217;s own or with Amazon&#8217;s Alexa, which will allow you to carry out actions comfortably without having to lift a finger.  And, all this, accompanied by a sound system that consists of two channels, so you have access to stereo -and, how can it be otherwise to comply with movies and series, there is support for standards such as <strong>Dolby<\/strong>-.
