Although sometimes these software solutions may seem the same, they are not.  Next, we will talk about two widely known proposals that are very different from each other, such as <strong>Chrome and Tor<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, we must bear in mind that, if we focus on the browser offered by the search giant <strong>Google<\/strong>, it is the most used.  In addition, the difference with respect to its competitors is enormous.  Chrome currently has a market penetration of around 65% of the global market in this sector.  On the other hand, we find another proposal that could be considered as one of the most distant in terms of operation, but that has much fewer users.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>With everything and with it if we talk about <strong>Tor Browser<\/strong>, we find a software that has its followers due to certain functionalities and behaviors that it offers.  Everything will depend on the demands that each user has or the needs that need to be covered.  Precisely for all this, below we are going to talk about the main differences that we are going to find between these two popular alternatives.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is that there are many users around the world who tend to <strong>install both proposals<\/strong> and use them depending on the moment.  This is something we can understand more clearly once we know the <strong>differences between both browsers<\/strong>, Which are important.  Next, we will show you some of the most significant ones so that you can get a funny idea of \u200b\u200bwhere Google Chrome and Tor Browser are headed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-456022\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653846923_395_Differences-between-Google-Chrome-and-Tor.jpg\" alt=\"Thor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"587\"  \/><\/p>\n<h2>Which to choose, Chrome or Tor Browser<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Privacy, differentiating element<\/strong>: There is no doubt that the biggest difference between both proposals is in privacy.  While Google and its telemetry and tracking are behind the development of Chrome, Tor is the private browser par excellence.  In fact, it uses its own private network to avoid the monitoring and storage of data by the pages.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The engine they are based on<\/strong>: how could it be otherwise, Google&#8217;s proposal is based on the Chromium engine used by most current browsers.  On the contrary, the proposal focused on privacy bets on Mozilla Firefox and its development engine.  Despite being less used, everything related to security and privacy is very important here.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The smoothness of operation<\/strong>: However, one of the biggest drawbacks that we find in Tor is that access to web pages is somewhat slower in general terms.  This is something that can be clearly seen if we compare this section with Google&#8217;s proposal, it is the price of privacy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Compatible Devices<\/strong>: It is also important to consider compatible systems and devices.  We can use Chrome on almost all platforms and computers, both desktop and mobile, but Tor is a bit more limited in this regard.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use of extensions<\/strong>: If we focus on Tor Browser, we will tell you that the use of extensions here is also much more limited than in Chrome.  In fact, most of the developers of these plugins release them for the Google browser and those compatible with Chromium.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Among the wide range of web browsers to choose from that we currently have, users prioritize some aspects over others.
