In late 2019, the IPTV provider found itself extorted by a hacker who claimed to have obtained the details of around 121,000 of its subscribers.  PrimeStreams customers were informed immediately to avoid major disasters, especially with the possession of payment data by this hacker.<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1649049\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1649049\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653062275_388_After-the-extortion-of-a-hacker-a-pirate-IPTV-faces.jpg\" alt=\"Pirate IPTV\" width=\"715\" height=\"374\"\/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1649049\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pirate IPTV<\/p>\n<p>The attacker exploited a password in the service&#8217;s billing panel and then informed the service through its own ticketing system about what had happened.
