However, it is true that we do not depend only on our own behavior but also on that of other road users.  For this reason, and to have better access to them, the DGT has chosen to install new road signs <strong>to avoid accidents<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>Some new signals from the DGT to attract attention<\/h2>\n<p>The 30 km\/h limit in the city has reduced deaths by 14%, according to the DGT.  And it is that, the institution puts the magnifying glass in avoiding accidents.  An example of this is the implementation of new signals for <strong>Get attention<\/strong> of the drivers.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, as is logical and normal, before homologating a new road marking and extending it throughout the road network, a previous step is required: <strong>test its effectiveness<\/strong>.  It would be useless for the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda to allocate a budget item to paint thousands of new road markings on the asphalt of the roads under its jurisdiction if drivers are not fully familiar with them and ignore the themselves.<\/p>\n<p>That is why now it has been opted for and decided on new intelligent signals, from the DGT, which <strong>can be more familiar<\/strong> For the users.  In those, what we have now is a type of these signs that are being seen in a way that can be done because the limits are respected much more.<\/p>\n<h2>As they are<\/h2>\n<p>In this way, the General Directorate of Traffic is working on different proposals that will make driving on our roads much safer, but one of the most vulnerable groups are <strong>cyclists<\/strong>which continue to suffer abuses despite various initiatives launched by the government.<\/p>\n<p>The same, in their case, do so by incorporating three lights that begin to flash when a sensor detects the passage of one or more cyclists.  Thus, these work with solar panels that, together with a plaque on which you can read &#8216;<strong>Near cyclist light on<\/strong>&#8216;, the vehicles that pass by there in the following moments already know that a little later they will meet one or several cyclists, reducing the risk of being run over.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>As a test, the DGT has installed these signs on the section of the CM-2105 road, belonging to Castilla-La Mancha, which runs between Cuenca capital and Tragacete, which they do to warn of the <strong>presence of cyclists on the road<\/strong>.  As such, these are intended to be placed in areas with poor visibility.<\/p>\n<h3>Other specific signs of cyclists that you must differentiate<\/h3>\n<p>Similarly, cyclists, unlike other vehicles, do not need a driver&#8217;s license to ride a bicycle, but it is necessary to know the traffic signs that <strong>can affect circulation<\/strong>.  We could say that before learning to ride a bike it is essential and almost mandatory to know the basic traffic signs.<\/p>\n<p>Just as every cyclist should know the bicycle signs to use while riding a bicycle, the same goes for bicycle traffic signs.  These are the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sign <strong>reserved path<\/strong> for cycles or cyclists.  Round with a blue background, it forces cyclists and cycles to circulate on the road.  At the same time, this sign prohibits other vehicles from driving on this road.  It should be noted that, if you are riding a bike and you have a sign like this and you are not riding on it, you may be able to receive a financial penalty, since your obligation is to ride on it.  Once you see the same sign, but crossed out, it means that the road reserved for cyclists or cycles ends.<\/li>\n<li><strong>danger cyclists<\/strong>.  Triangular in shape, it warns of the proximity of a path for cyclists, such as a bike lane or a place where cyclists frequent.  With this sign you should pay special attention, since it is possible that you can find a cyclist on the road.<\/li>\n<li>Signal of <strong>bike lane or bike lane<\/strong> attached to the road.  This sign will indicate that the lane on which the sign with the bicycle is located can only be used by cycles or bicycles.  The arrows on the sign will indicate the number of lanes there are and their direction of travel.<\/li>\n<li><strong>cycle path<\/strong>.  This sign will let you know that there is a cycle and pedestrian lane that is separated from motor vehicle traffic.  This signal can usually be found in large spaces such as parks or gardens.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the key aspects that guarantee success in driving is respect for traffic and safety regulations.
