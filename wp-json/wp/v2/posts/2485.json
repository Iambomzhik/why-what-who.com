Thanks to this service, you can have <strong>more than one SIM card sharing the same rate among all<\/strong> calls and data.<\/p>\n<h2>Yoigo Multi SIM limits<\/h2>\n<p>As is often the case with other operators,<strong> Yoigo&#8217;s MultiSim comes with some limitations<\/strong> that you should take into account before going to a store to request it.  This service will cost 3 euros per month for each SIM, with a maximum of 4 lines in which to activate it.  The types of devices supported are those common in other operators: phones, tablets, laptops and smartwatches.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">Hello!  Our e-Sim and multisim service are available in store.  If you want you can stop by one to advise you whenever you want.  Thank you very much!  \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\u2013 Yoigo (@yoigo) May 25, 2022<\/p>\n<p>These secondary lines dependent on our main rate will also have a limitation on the number of gigabytes they can consume, even if the main line is, for example, the Endless Infinite GB rate, which does not have said gigabyte restriction.  The SIMs of the additional devices <strong>they will only be able to spend 20 GB per month<\/strong>.  For other services, such as calls or sending SMS text messages, the limits will be those of your rate (if any).<\/p>\n<p>The MultiSIM service shares the voice and data rate that we have contracted on the main line, allowing<strong> calls automatically come through on all devices<\/strong> and being able to answer from any of them.  Of course, it is important to bear in mind that when an incoming call is picked up from any of our devices with MultiSIM, a missed call notification will appear on the rest of the devices.<\/p>\n<h2>eSim, the other alternative<\/h2>\n<p>As the operator recalls on social networks, the alternative of the company&#8217;s eSim or virtual SIM is also available, which must also be requested at your nearest Yoigo store.  The eSIM or virtual SIM is the evolution of the physical SIM card that we have used until now, it is integrated into the device and you only have to activate it, by scanning a QR code, to connect to your operator&#8217;s network.  It facilitates the portability process by not having to change cards and in this case, it allows you to carry more than one number on the same phone.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1302039\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Yoigo<\/p>\n<p>Once you have identified yourself in your store and have requested the eSIM, they will send you an email to the address you have configured in your client area.  This e-mail contains the necessary data to activate the service: a QR code, the PIN and the PUK of the SIM.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have scanned the QR code on your mobile, you will need to have the mobile connected to activate your eSIM.  Once scanned, confirm the activation by entering the PIN code that appears next to the QR that will be sent to you.  Accept the confirmation message and your eSIM will be correctly configured.  If your eSIM replaces a physical SIM, remove the old SIM from the device.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Multi Sim service is ideal for those who have more and more devices that allow them to connect to the Internet via SIM card and mobile data bonus, but do not simply want to tether and share data between them.
