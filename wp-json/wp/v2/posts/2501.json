This does not make much sense for documents with few pages, but it is vital if we have something large.  This index also links to each title in the document, so that any reader can move to the part of the text that interests him without having to search for it.<\/p>\n<h2>Creating indexes in Google Docs is very simple<\/h2>\n<p>As you may have read a few lines ago, both Microsoft Word and Google Docs are two great software full of features.  The one owned by Microsoft is also obviously capable of indexing.  However, with him it will be somewhat more tedious, and although the result will be just as good, it is worth doing directly <strong>via google word processor<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Before we start making the index, <strong>the most important thing we have to do is format the text<\/strong>.  If we have a text (it does not matter if it is 5 pages or 50) and we have it as it is written, without any type of title or heading it will be impossible to make an index.  The type of text that we have already written is what is called &#8220;normal text&#8221; in Google Docs itself, and this will not appear in the index at any time.  What does appear in the index will be the different types of titles that exist, and with which we can create our index.  In order they would be: <strong>title, subtitle, heading 1, heading 2 and heading 3<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>   <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1686474\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Available paragraph styles.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to point out that there is no perfect format, since it will depend on each person or according to the need of the text.  What is clear is that if we do not apply one to our document we will not have the possibility of creating an index.  Once you have your formatted text, it will be our turn to index.  To do this, all we have to do is click on the upper part of the screen on <strong>Insert<\/strong>, <strong>and choose the last option, which indicates index<\/strong>.  We can choose between two versions, one with numbers and the other with links only.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best things about indexing in Google Docs is that <strong>we do not have to wait for the complete document to insert it<\/strong>.  If we introduce the index as soon as we start, and while we are writing the text we format it, the system will recognize it and update the index based on the structure that we are giving it.  It&#8217;s very simple, all you have to do is click on it where a button with an arrow appears (Update Index).<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1686678\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1686678\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653735103_60_So-you-can-create-indexes-in-Google-Docs.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"356\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1686678\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is how the index would look in Google Docs<\/p>\n<p>Every time we click on one of the titles, subtitles or headers in the index, a link will appear that will automatically take us to the part of the document where said text is found.  With this we will have created a fully functional index, although it may happen that we do not want it or that we simply want to know how it is eliminated.  To do this, all we have to do is <strong>select it completely and press delete<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>Can I create indexes on Android or iOS?<\/h2>\n<p>We have shown you the easiest way to create an index in Google Docs which is through your computer, but you may also be using the tool on your Android or iOS device.  Both platforms have their own applications available for Google Docs, and although these are practically the same, there is a very important difference to take into account: <strong>you will not be able to create indexes in Android<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, <strong>yes we have that possibility in iOS<\/strong>.  To do this, as happens on the computer, the first thing will be to format the text.  We will only have to press the button at the top of the screen with an A and a horizontal line below it so that the different types of texts appear on the screen.  Once we have in format, <strong>we will click on the + button<\/strong> that there is above and we will select, as in a computer, index.<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1686792\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1686792\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653735103_206_So-you-can-create-indexes-in-Google-Docs.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"231\" height=\"500\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1686792\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A function that we only have on iOS.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In case by chance you don&#8217;t know what an index is, it is an element that we can introduce in our documents that indicates its structure..
