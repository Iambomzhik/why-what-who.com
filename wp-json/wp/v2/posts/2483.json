That is the case, for example, of <strong>Erling Haland<\/strong> Y <strong>Mohammed Salah<\/strong>: The prices of their passes are among the highest in the world, but their salaries are not yet.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The 10 highest paid soccer players in the world<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>Neymar<\/strong> He is the soccer player with the best salary in the world, with 4,083,000 euros. That&#8217;s what he currently pays the <strong>PSG<\/strong>although the sports press talks that they could sell him, so his contractual situation could change.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, the team that really wants to make an offer for the Brazilian will hardly be able to expect to pay much less than what <strong>Neymar<\/strong> He currently earns, because at 30 years old he is still at the top of his price.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Leo Messi <\/strong>He is the second highest paid player in the world, since he receives 3,375,000 euros. At 34 years old, he is still in top form, but his performance curve has already started to decline, so barring an offer from the league of <strong>China<\/strong> or another country with a lower soccer level and billionaire club owners, the Argentine will not continue to earn as much.<\/p>\n<p>At 37 years old, it is also not very feasible that <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo <\/strong>raise your salary level, but it is remarkable that at that age you are third in the world with your salary. The crash of <strong>Man Utd <\/strong>He has managed to extend his career at the highest level, although he has not been able to take his latest teams to international trophies like the ones he achieved with <strong>real Madrid<\/strong>. The Portuguese earns 2,630,000 euros per month.<\/p>\n<p>The same salary that I would be earning <strong>Gerard Piqu\u00e9<\/strong>the central defender of <strong>Barcelona<\/strong>, which appears tied for third place, but which we put in fourth because, it is assumed, that high payment would only be something that is fulfilled on paper. This because, after a reduction in his contract, the Spaniard would be earning 4.6 million for the full season.<\/p>\n<p>The fifth highest salary in the world for a footballer is that of <strong>Gareth Bale<\/strong>. As much as in recent times the Welshman has not been the protagonist in the <strong>real Madrid<\/strong>his salary of over 2,270,000 million euros places him in such a privileged position.<\/p>\n<p>Situation similar to that of his teammate, <strong>Eden Hazard<\/strong>who playing even less than <strong>bale<\/strong>, charge the same as him. then comes <strong>Kylian Mbappe<\/strong>which appears in seventh position for little, since his salary is 2,220,000 euros.<\/p>\n<p>eighth stands <strong>Kevin deBruyne<\/strong>with 2,060,000 (the second highest paid in the <strong>premier league<\/strong>in back of <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo<\/strong>), and ninth appears <strong>Robert Lewandowski <\/strong>(the highest paid of the <strong>Bundesliga<\/strong>), with 2 million closed.<\/p>\n<p>Closing the top 10 is the only goalkeeper in the ranking, <strong>David De Gea<\/strong>. The goalkeeper of <strong>Man Utd <\/strong>receives a salary of 1,930,000 euros.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Posted in TRENDS on 5\/9\/2022 4:50 p.m. The figures that soccer players earn reach the unimaginable, and the best salaries are surpassed almost every year, reaching the top 10 that we present in this note of the highest paid players in the world.
