Television has become a very important point within the services offered by the main Spanish operators, and every very little time we are seeing how they all move to make their own much more attractive.  The last to move for it has been Orange, <strong>thanks to a new agreement with AMC Networks International Southern Europe<\/strong> (AMCNISE). <\/p>\n<p>Orange TV, the television of the orange operator, has been offering its users for quite some time an offer of thematic channels with content of all kinds (whether movies or series), as well as the best sport with football as the flag.  The arrival of this new AMC service, called AMC+, <strong>does nothing but enhance this offer<\/strong>and which also arrives in our country with some very interesting premieres.<\/p>\n<h2>AMC+ will land in Orange in June<\/h2>\n<p>In case you don&#8217;t know, AMC+ is what is known as <strong>an on-demand subscription service<\/strong> (or SVOD), and with it will come to Orange TV a large amount of exclusive content from AMC.  The arrival of AMC+ represents a further step in the relationship between the two companies, since in fact Orange TV has <strong>16 linear channels of AMCNISE<\/strong>.  With this service, a catalog of critically acclaimed series, as well as franchises much loved by fans, true crime series, original comedies and new movies and successful series from the United States and the United Kingdom, will reach the orange operator&#8217;s television. United.<\/p>\n<p>With the landing of AMC+ on Orange TV, some very interesting premiere series will arrive.  Among them stand out \u00ab<strong>61st Street<\/strong>&#8220;, centered on a high school athlete whose future is upended by the Chicago court system, or &#8220;<strong>firebite<\/strong>\u00ab, a series with vampires that promises many frenetic sequences.  In addition, we can also expect in the AMC + the arrival in the future of other AMC productions such as those that come from the <strong>The walking dead universe<\/strong>.  In the words of Ignacio Garc\u00eda-Legaz, general director of Orange TV:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first incorporation of AMC+ allows us to add iconic and recognized series, thus reinforcing our offer of cinema and series for all our clients, and confirming Orange TV as one of the most varied and extensive content aggregation platforms in the Spanish audiovisual market, with options and genres for all audiences.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1646721\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rob Collins as Tyson on Firebite (AMC+)<\/p>\n<p>To be able to enjoy AMC+ within Orange TV we still have to wait a little longer, since the arrival of this SVOD service <strong>It won&#8217;t happen until next June.<\/strong>.  As with the rest of the AMCNISE content, the entire catalog that AMC+ will offer can be enjoyed in both HD and 4K quality, and of course also on all compatible devices (smartphone, tablet, Smart TV and PC).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gone is the time when telephone operators only offered Internet or mobile lines as main claims.
