To be able to access it we have an icon in the notification area from where we can carry out the few configuration options that it offers us.  In this way we will have to click on the OneDrive icon in the lower right corner.<\/p>\n<p>This will cause a menu to be displayed where we must click on the gear-shaped icon, which will cause another list to be displayed where we will select the section of <strong>Setting<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>This will cause a pop-up window to open where we will click on the <strong>Bill<\/strong>.

We will check which files take up more storage space and thus be able to free up space.

Once logged in, all the files and folders stored will appear.

Likewise, Microsoft puts at our disposal a referral program that allows us to<strong> get extra storage space<\/strong> by inviting other people to use the cloud service.  Each person who signs up for OneDrive with our referral link will get an extra 0.5GB and we can get up to 10GB of extra storage.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-733824 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653214273_95_How-to-view-OneDrive-free-storage-space-in-Windows.jpg\" alt=\"OneDrive invite friends\" width=\"920\" height=\"409\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>To do this, in the Your additional storage section, click on the Get more link.
