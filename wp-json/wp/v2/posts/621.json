When does the phase change occur?  With the 2022 Lunar Calendar you will be able to know exactly how the Moon looks from Earth, any day of the year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Humans have been fascinated by the Moon since prehistoric times.<\/strong>.  Some anthropologists argue that it has been <strong>one of the catalysts of human evolution<\/strong>: Looking at the Moon, Humanity began to wonder.<\/p>\n<p>What is that in the sky?  Why does it change places?  How can I get there?  These questions motivated many human beings to <strong>follow the path of science.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is not strange that <strong>Humanity&#8217;s first calendars<\/strong>, dating from 8,000 years ago, were lunar.  And it&#8217;s the reason that <strong>the original months lasted 29 days<\/strong>how long it takes one lunar cycle.<\/p>\n<p>      <\/p>\n<h3 class=\"embed-article-title\">\n<p>      What would happen if there was no Moon?<\/p>\n<\/h3>\n<p><strong>This cycle is divided into four phases.<\/strong>and for millennia it was used to plant crops, to calculate the birth of children, or to meet other people, close businesses, and other events.<\/p>\n<p>Some of these situations are still ruled by the Moon, but most people go to the <strong>Lunar Calendar 2022<\/strong> out of curiosity, to find out when our satellite changes phase, or when is the best time to photograph it.<\/p>\n<p>As we have mentioned, the Moon has 4 phases: <strong>New moon, first quarter, full moon, and last quarter<\/strong>.  Although there are several subphases in between.<\/p>\n<p>In 2022, as explained by our colleague Daniel C\u00e1ceres in Business Insider, the moon will have <strong>12 full cycles, and half another.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is the most common situation, because the calendar has one more day than the lunar months, as it is coordinated with the time it takes for the Earth to revolve around the Sun.<\/p>\n<p>These are <strong>the four phases of the moon<\/strong>and how to distinguish them:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>new moon (or new moon)<\/strong>: In this phase the Moon is barely visible, because the face that always faces the Earth is not illuminated by the Sun. And we can only see it when the sun reflects light on it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>first quarter<\/strong>: The right side of the Moon is illuminated in the northern hemisphere, and the other way around in the southern one.<\/li>\n<li><strong>full moon (or full moon)<\/strong>: It is the most spectacular, because the Sun illuminates it completely, and we can see it completely.<\/li>\n<li><strong>last quarter<\/strong>: we can only see its left side illuminated in the northern hemisphere (as if it were the letter C), and vice versa in the southern hemisphere.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As we have mentioned, each lunar cycle lasts just over 29 days.<\/p>\n<p>Business Insider compiled it on <strong>Lunar Calendar 2022<\/strong> which you can see here:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New Moon<\/strong>: January 2, 2022 at 7:33 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>First quarter: January 10, 2022 at 7:11 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Full moon: January 18, 2022 at 00:48 hours<\/li>\n<li>Last quarter: January 25, 2022 at 2:41 p.m.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New Moon<\/strong>: February 1, 2022 at 06:46 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>First quarter: February 8, 2022 at 2:50 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Full moon: February 16, 2022 at 5:56 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Last quarter: February 23, 2022 at 11:32 p.m.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New Moon<\/strong>: March 2, 2022 at 6:35 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>First quarter: March 10, 2022 at 11:45 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>Full moon: March 18, 2022 at 08:18 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>Last Quarter: March 25, 2022 at 06:37 a.m.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New Moon<\/strong>: April 1, 2022 at 08:24 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>First quarter: April 9, 2022 at 08:48 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>Full moon: April 16, 2022 at 8:55 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Last Quarter: April 23, 2022 at 1:56 p.m.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New Moon<\/strong>: April 30, 2022 at 10:28 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>First quarter: May 9, 2022 at 02:21 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>Full Moon: May 16, 2022 at 06:14 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>Last Quarter: May 22, 2022 at 8:43 p.m.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New Moon<\/strong>: May 30, 2022 at 1:30 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>First quarter: June 7, 2022 at 4:48 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Full moon: June 14, 2022 at 1:51 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Last Quarter: June 21, 2022 at 05:11 a.m.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to miss a single star or planet at night, start the adventure with one of these telescopes to observe the sky.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New Moon<\/strong>: June 29, 2022 at 04:52 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>First quarter: July 7, 2022 at 04:14 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>Full moon: July 13, 2022 at 8:37 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Last Quarter: July 20, 2022 at 4:18 p.m.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New Moon<\/strong>: July 28, 2022 at 7:55 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>First quarter: August 5, 2022 at 1:06 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Full Moon: August 12, 2022 at 03:36 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>Last Quarter: August 19, 2022 at 06:36 a.m.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New Moon<\/strong>: August 27, 2022 at 10:17 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>First quarter: September 3, 2022 at 8:08 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Full moon: September 10, 2022 at 11:59 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>Last quarter: September 17, 2022 at 11:52 p.m.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New Moon<\/strong>: September 25, 2022 at 11:54 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>First quarter: October 3, 2022 at 02:14 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>Full moon: October 9, 2022 at 10:55 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Last Quarter: October 17, 2022 at 7:15 p.m.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New Moon<\/strong>: October 25, 2022 at 12:48 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>First quarter: November 1, 2022 at 07:37 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>Full moon: November 8, 2022 at 12:02 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Last Quarter: November 16, 2022 at 2:27 p.m.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New Moon<\/strong>: November 23, 2022 at 11:57 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>First quarter: November 30, 2022 at 3:36 p.m.<\/li>\n<li>Full moon: December 8, 2022 at 05:08 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>Last Quarter: December 16, 2022 at 09:56 a.m.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New Moon<\/strong>: December 23, 2022 at 11:17 a.m.<\/li>\n<li>First quarter: December 30, 2022 at 02:20 a.m.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Today we are in a first quarter, and we will change to a full moon the day after tomorrow, on February 16.<\/p>\n<p>The new cycle will begin on March 2.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is a lunar calendar?
