Streaming platforms have burst in kicking the door, and there are so many and so good ones available that sometimes it&#8217;s hard to choose which one.  While some paid ones such as Netflix or Disney + stand out from the rest, we must not lose sight of the free options that exist.  One of them is Tivify, which as time goes by increases the offer of free channels to be stronger.  From today, <strong>a new one will be inside your grill<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>It is true that Tivify offers payment methods, but the one that is free is impressive. <strong>It already offers more than 120 channels without having to pay a penny<\/strong>, and the best thing is that the platform is determined to become stronger and stronger.  A few days ago two new channels arrived, and today, May 27, an additional one does.<\/p>\n<h2>The new channel to arrive at Tivify is Bon Dia TV<\/h2>\n<p>As we say, Tivify is every so often reaching agreements to improve its channel lineup.  On this occasion, the new agreement signed between this streaming platform and the Catalan Corporaci\u00f3 de Mitjans Audiovisuales (CCMA), the Corporaci\u00f3 Valenciana de Mitjans de Comunicaci\u00f3 (CVMC) and the Ens P\u00fablic de Radiotelevisi\u00f3 de les Illes Balears (EPRTVIB) has meant that <strong>the Bon Dia TV channel reaches Tivify completely free for its users<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>This agreement is tremendously important for Tivify, since thanks to it it becomes <strong>the first platform of its kind to broadcast it<\/strong>.  Bon Dia TV is a channel created between TV3, \u00c0 Punt and IB3 to offer content that shares the same linguistic field on the same site.  This channel, which will come <strong>to dial 160<\/strong> of the platform, will offer series, movies, documentaries, travel, cooking, literature and sports programs.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1688547\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bon Dia TV comes to Tivify.<\/p>\n<p>Being a creation of the three groups, what we are going to be able to find here is really the fusion of the three, among which we are going to be able to have a lot of content created by all of them.  On Bon Dia TV we can see <strong>series like La Riera or Com si fos ahir<\/strong>;  cooking programs such as Cuina amb Santi Taura or Cuines y Cuines i Cuiners, and informative programs such as 30 minuts, among many other programmes.<\/p>\n<h2>Tivify&#8217;s offer, getting better and better<\/h2>\n<p>Tivify may not be given as much prominence as other free alternatives like Rakuten TV, but nobody can deny that this platform has been doing very well in recent months.  Your free subscription <strong>it only requires that we register with an email<\/strong>, and in return it gives us access to more than 120 free channels where we have all kinds of options, from DTT options to others specialized in series or movies.  In addition, this free version does not even limit where you can enjoy its content, being able to do it both in a web browser and on your Smart TV or on a mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>If you really like the content that you have available for free, you may be interested to know that with <strong>payment methods we have access to even more channels<\/strong>.  In addition, with these modalities we will be able to have two devices simultaneously with the same account without problems, and the option to record everything we want up to 150 or 350 hours, depending on the subscription we choose.  The two subscriptions available are <strong>Tivify Plus for 3.99 euros per month<\/strong>Y <strong>Tivify Premium for 7.99 euros per month<\/strong>.  If you get a whole year of Tivify Premium it will only cost you 69.95 euros, so the month will cost you 5.83.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is now a reality, a few years ago was a true utopia.
