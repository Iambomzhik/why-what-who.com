Gone are the projections in theaters that invited the public to put on those white glasses with a different color for the eye.  Today, this technology has evolved into many other things such as virtual reality or augmented reality, although it is still used for other things such as photography, and we can use it ourselves with our smartphones.<\/p>\n<p>If you think that taking 3D photos is complicated or that it requires you to get special equipment, you are very wrong.  With these applications that you have below you can take 3D photos with very good quality from your smartphone, and you can use them on social networks or wherever you want.<\/p>\n<h2>move pic<\/h2>\n<p>Movepic is one of the best mobile applications with which to &#8220;give life&#8221; to our photos.
