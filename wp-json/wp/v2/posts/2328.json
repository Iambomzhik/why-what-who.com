You will only have to log in to your Facebook account as usual and you will see a text box appear that allows you to delete all the chats after confirming that you want to carry out the process, to avoid accidental deletions.<\/p>\n<h2>Automatically delete messages<\/h2>\n<p>If you think you will need to delete messages on a regular basis, you can activate some methods to self-destruct conversations.  This process can be done in two different ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Temporary mode or &#8220;vanish&#8221;<\/strong>: using this option the messages will be deleted as soon as we leave the conversation with our friend.<\/li>\n<li><strong>secret conversation<\/strong>: This alternative was already known for a long time in the web version.  Here the messages will be deleted after the end of a timer that we will select.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The only drawback is that this process can only be done from the Messenger app for our phone.  That is, the process is not compatible with the web version of this service.<\/p>\n<h2>Delete Messenger chats from mobile<\/h2>\n<p>You may be one of those who prefer the smartphone to manage your messaging apps, so we are going to tell you about the process, which in general terms is quite identical to the one you have to carry out via PC.<\/p>\n<p>From our mobile it will be necessary to press the information icon in the upper right margin and then the three points on the profile of the person or persons in the conversation that you want to delete.  Once pressed, an options menu will appear and we press Delete conversation.<\/p>\n<p>The last thing will be to accept a confirmation message \u00ab<strong>Delete the entire conversation?  Once you delete your copy of the conversation, you won&#8217;t be able to get it back<\/strong>\u00ab.
