It is a method with which your interlocutor will not be able to see your telephone number when you call him, and therefore neither know that it is you, nor call you back nor save your telephone number in the phonebook afterwards.<\/p>\n<p>Hiding this number is really not as difficult as it seems, since <strong>all mobiles offer the possibility to do it<\/strong> in your configuration.  We are going to explain three methods, starting with how to configure it on Android.  Then we will tell you how to do it on iOS as well, and we will finish by telling you the codes that you can dial when typing the number you are going to call to hide your number in a specific call that you are going to make.<\/p>\n<p>    <\/p>\n<h2>How to make calls from hidden number on Android<\/h2>\n<p>  <img class=\"sf-lazy centro_sinmarco\"  src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653044537_373_How-to-make-calls-from-a-hidden-number-on-Android.jpg\" alt=\"A1\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>On Android, the option to set up hidden number calls can vary depending on the device, although they are always in the phone app.  We are going from the Google Phone application, where when you are on the main screen you have to <strong>click on the three dots button<\/strong> that you have on the top right.<\/p>\n<p>  <img class=\"sf-lazy centro_sinmarco\"  src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653044537_169_How-to-make-calls-from-a-hidden-number-on-Android.jpg\" alt=\"A2\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>When you press the three dots button, a menu with options will open.

In this menu, you have to <strong>click on the More settings option<\/strong>.  If the call application is different, the option may have a different name, such as Additional services in the case of Samsung mobiles.<\/p>\n<p>  <img class=\"sf-lazy centro_sinmarco\"  src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653044538_493_How-to-make-calls-from-a-hidden-number-on-Android.jpg\" alt=\"A4\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>Once you are in the More settings menu, or the name that your mobile manufacturer has used in its calling application for additional options, <strong>click on the option Show my caller ID<\/strong> that will appear at the top.<\/p>\n<p>  <img class=\"sf-lazy centro_sinmarco\"  src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653044539_110_How-to-make-calls-from-a-hidden-number-on-Android.jpg\" alt=\"TO 5\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>When you click on the Show my caller ID option, a window will open with the options to hide the number or show it.  In this window, <strong>click on the option Hide number<\/strong> And that&#8217;s it, from now on you can make calls with a hidden number until you return to this menu to indicate otherwise.<\/p>\n<h2>How to make calls from hidden number on iPhone<\/h2>\n<p>  <img class=\"sf-lazy centro_sinmarco\"  src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653044539_730_How-to-make-calls-from-a-hidden-number-on-Android.jpg\" alt=\"Phone\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>On iOS the process is even faster.  If you have an iPhone, the first thing you have to do is <strong>go to the device Settings and click on the Phone option<\/strong> to enter the call function settings.<\/p>\n<p>  <img class=\"sf-lazy centro_sinmarco\"  src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653044539_494_How-to-make-calls-from-a-hidden-number-on-Android.jpg\" alt=\"caller id\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>Once you enter the phone settings, you have to <strong>click on the option Show caller ID<\/strong>which is the last one that will appear in the Calls section that you will see almost at the top.<\/p>\n<p>  <img class=\"sf-lazy centro_sinmarco\"  src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653044540_506_How-to-make-calls-from-a-hidden-number-on-Android.jpg\" alt=\"show id\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>You will go to a screen where you only have one option, so there is no place to get lost either.  Here, <strong>turn off the Show Caller ID option<\/strong> pressing on the button that will be on the right until the lever is rotated to the left of the button.  And that&#8217;s it, from now on you can make calls with a hidden number until you return to this menu to indicate otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>    <img src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652867183_436_How-to-find-out-who-owns-a-phone-number.jpg\" alt=\"How to set a ringtone for a contact on Android \"\/><\/p>\n<h2>Codes to call with a hidden number<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to changes to device settings, <strong>there is a series of codes with which you can make calls with a hidden number<\/strong> without messing around with the phone and directly from the call option.  To apply them, go to the Phone application and enter the section where you dial the number to call. <\/p>\n<p>We will teach you first <strong>the code to call with a hidden number in a single call<\/strong>.  This code varies depending on the country, but in the case of Spain it is #31# followed by the number you are going to call.  For example, if you are calling &#8220;111222333&#8221;, the number to dial is &#8220;#31#111222333&#8221;, without the quotes.  The caller will receive the call, but the number will be hidden.  You can also save this number in the phone book with the code so that you always call it with a hidden call.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, you also have this other series of codes: * <strong>If you press *31# and the call button<\/strong>, you permanently activate call hiding.  * <strong>If you press #31# and the call button<\/strong>, you permanently disable call hiding.  * <strong>If you press #31# followed by the number<\/strong>you turn on call hiding for one call only.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>we will explain how to make calls from a hidden number, both on Android phones and iPhones.
