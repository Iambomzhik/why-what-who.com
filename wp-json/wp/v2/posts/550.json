These allow us to move freely both within our borders and outside of it, so it is very important that we keep them in the best possible condition.  Both documents have an expiration date, so every so often we have to renew them.  We can wait for these to expire for this, but<strong>did you know that you can also renew them long before<\/strong>?<\/p>\n<p>The expiration date of both identity documents is one of the most important elements that we must take into account.  When we are young, these documents always have <strong>quite a long date<\/strong>, so it is very easy to forget about it and realize when \u201cit is too late\u201d.  An expired document at a bad time could play a trick on us, such as leaving us on the ground without being able to catch a plane.<\/p>\n<h2>How do I renew my DNI and my passport?<\/h2>\n<p>Renewing the DNI and the passport is a really simple process, but it never hurts to remember.  To do this, we must bear in mind that we need to have with us the document that has expired or is about to expire, along with <strong>a recent quality color photograph<\/strong>.  It is essential that first of all we meet these two requirements, although the Police also admits renewing the DNI and the passport in those cases in which we have lost it or it has been stolen.  In this scenario, it is necessary to present the complaint or proof of loss.<\/p>\n<p>With these two things, the only thing left for us to renew our DNI or passport is to request an appointment for it.  A few years ago, it was enough to go to a police station first thing in the morning to renew our documents, but today this is not possible if we have not made an appointment.  The only thing we will have to do is go to the web enabled for it and use one of the 3 forms that we will have available to identify ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>   <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1655166\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">3 options to make an appointment.<\/p>\n<p>The most common way to do it is using the data from our ID, which we must enter one by one by hand.  Once this is done, we will only have to choose the document that we want to renew, choose the province and the expedition team that best suits us, and of course, <strong>choose one of the dates that the web shows us that are available<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>Renew your documents well in advance<\/h2>\n<p>Now, how far in advance can we request to renew our identification documents?  The answer to this question is really simple, although it is different for the DNI and for the passport.  In the case of the first of these documents, as indicated by the Police, we can request an appointment for the renewal of the DNI <strong>within the last 180 days of validity of this<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udd0aRemember that you can renew your documents in advance:\u2935<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd34 The #DNI within the last 180 days of validity<br \/>\ud83d\udd34 The #Passport up to 1 year before<\/p>\n<p>  https:\/\/t.co\/O7bDmJ2CiD pic.twitter.com\/7TkAg53uSV<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 National Police (@policia) May 13, 2022<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, the scenario is even better to renew the passport.
