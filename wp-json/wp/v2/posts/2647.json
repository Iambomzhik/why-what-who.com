In fact, they are usually owners of real estate assets and on many occasions in what would be called collectibles. But what is the historical profitability of all these assets?<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Global Investment Returns Yearbook 2018&#8221;<strong> Credit Suisse <\/strong>publishes &#8220;the most comprehensive study ever published on long-term private asset returns compared to financial assets.&#8221; In many cases, they beat inflation and also offer their owners an &#8220;emotional dividend&#8221; that can attract investors, as well as allowing them to diversify assets.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Investing in the stock market, the most profitable thing since 1900<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As the Expansi\u00f3n newspaper points out, <strong>Investing in the stock market is, according to said study, the most profitable option from the period from 1900 to the present<\/strong>. The report indicates that investment in the stock market has offered a <strong>real average annualized return (discounting inflation) of 5.2% <\/strong>from 1900 to 2017, outperforming bonds and Treasury Bills.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the market, the percentages vary, but in all the countries analyzed, the profitability of the stock market has far exceeded that of the other assets indicated. A) Yes, <strong>In Spain, stock market returns have been close to 4% over the last 118 years, compared to almost 2% for bonds and practically 0% for Treasury bills.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Investing in housing depends a lot on the country<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The real estate market, one of the preferred investments by Spaniards, is also one of the preferred investments by people with high net worth. In fact, according to a recent report by the consultancy <strong>Knight Frank<\/strong> accumulates a <strong>24% of total accumulated assets<\/strong> for this group.<\/p>\n<p>Analyzing its real profitability in the last 118 years in a unified way is very difficult due to the multitude of micro-markets in the world. However, the Credit Suisse report has tried to do it at least by country. So, according to your numbers, <strong>performance varies greatly by country<\/strong>. In fact, $100 invested in housing in Australia in the year 1900 would currently be equivalent to $1,297 (x13 times but only a 2.2% annualized return), while in the United States it would barely represent $139 (that is, a return of 0.3% annualized).<\/p>\n<p>On average, <strong>real annualized return stands at 1.3%<\/strong>that is, an intermediate level of return between the stock market and bonds and that would mean that 100 dollars would now be equivalent to 457 dollars.<\/p>\n<p><img title=\"Historical housing profitability (1900-2017)\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653781960_931_What-are-the-most-profitable-investments-in-the-world-graphics.png\" alt=\"Historical housing profitability (1900-2017)\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Invest in collectibles (wine, violins, vintage cars, books, jewelry\u2026)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The most original part of the report deals in detail with the global profitability of assets such as <strong>wine, stamps<\/strong> (of disastrous memories in Spain due to the cases of Afinsa and Forum, but with some external interest) or more original as <strong>violins, books or vintage cars in front of the stock market. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the last 118 years, <strong>the value of an investment in the collectibles market has multiplied by 30 times<\/strong>which is equivalent to a <strong>annualized return of 2.9%.<\/strong> Within those investments for which data are available since 1900, <strong>wine is the most profitable investment with a real annualized appreciation of 3.7%. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If the graph is observed in detail, in front of the wine are the <strong>collector cars<\/strong> as the <strong>second most profitable investment<\/strong>. But this type of asset has not been present in the index since 1900, but has been included since the 1980s.<\/p>\n<p>Despite these returns, <strong>above all of them is the bag<\/strong>as its 5.2% annualized return is equivalent to the fact that $100 invested 118 years ago would be worth $38,700 today.<\/p>\n<p><img title=\"Historical profitability of different assets (1900-2017)\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653781960_123_What-are-the-most-profitable-investments-in-the-world-graphics.png\" alt=\"Historical profitability of different assets (1900-2017)\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Invest in the stock market, invest in housing, invest in wine, invest in jewelry, invest in vintage cars, invest in violins&#8230; When it comes to investing, investors (especially those with high net worth) often look for profitability beyond financial assets for diversify your wealth and be less affected by the possible fluctuations that affect any [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2651,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2647"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2647"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2647\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2837,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2647\/revisions\/2837"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2651"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2647"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2647"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2647"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
