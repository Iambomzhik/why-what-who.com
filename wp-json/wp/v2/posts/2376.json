This is something that has been happening for years, a sector that is covered by a multitude of alternatives, among which we can highlight the popular WinZip.<\/p>\n<p>Here we refer specifically to software that has been with us for decades offering its data compression and decompression services.  These specific programs can be very helpful when it comes to <strong>save disk space<\/strong>, among other tasks.  For example, if we want to combine a large number of files and folders into one to share online, these compressors will also help us.  But as has happened with many other sectors, this one has evolved greatly over time.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the alternatives that we find focused on these tasks want to go one step further.  This is precisely the case that we mentioned to you. <strong>WinZip<\/strong>, as discussed below.  In the same way, we can find both free and paid options, although generally the functionality between the two can be important.  Precisely in these same lines we are going to talk about some of the reasons why you could choose to use WinZip instead of a free compressor.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously all those who no longer need to perform file and folder compression and decompression functions, <strong>any of the free ones will do the job<\/strong>.  However, both on a personal and professional level, sometimes we need software to help us with other tasks, as is the case here.<\/p>\n<h2>Reasons to use WinZip over freeware<\/h2>\n<p>And it is that over time the proposal that we mentioned has become a complete suite with multiple functions, but yes, we have to pay for them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows optimization features<\/strong>: most of us know the advantages and utilities that these file compression and decompression tasks offer us.  But as we mentioned, WinZip goes a step further and presents us with some interesting optimization functions to improve the <strong>Microsoft system operation<\/strong>.  We will be able to optimize the start, eliminate duplicate content, increase the autonomy of the laptop, and much more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>work in the cloud<\/strong>: One of the main tasks of this type of applications in particular is to allow us to save space on local drives.  But in addition to all this, the payment proposal that we are talking about now wants to go one step further.  For this he offers us up to <strong>50 gigabytes of storage on their servers<\/strong> in the cloud so that we save our compressed files or any other information.  In addition, all this will allow us to share the files generated in the program with other users through the Internet.<\/li>\n<li><strong>integrated security<\/strong>: It should be noted that in this software proposal we find some interesting security functions.  These are used in the folder files with which we work here, for example a system of <strong>256-bit AES encryption<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>office utilities<\/strong>: to all this, we can add that we will have some interesting office tools integrated into the WinZip compressor.  These will help us work with files in format <strong>PDF<\/strong>carry out <strong>Backups<\/strong>schedule rest reminders, and more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is more than likely that many of you have some file compressor installed on your PC.
