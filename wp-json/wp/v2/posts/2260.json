Obviously, it was not accidental, but the data of minors was later shared with advertising or technology companies.  Specifically, they were shared and sold with 199 online advertising companies.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The data was collected in most cases secretly and <strong>without the consent of children or their parents<\/strong>collecting data on who they are, where they are, what they do in the classroom, who their family and friends are, and what kind of device their families can afford,\u201d says EdTech Exposed research by Human Rights Watch.<\/p>\n<p>This research has analyzed a total of 164 educational platforms from 49 countries, including Spain.  146 of them, 89% of those analyzed, have shown positive results in terms of collecting data from minors without parental consent or from the spied on themselves.  Among the set of data stolen without consent are the location, visits to different web pages or their behavior outside of online classes.  Even <strong>cameras and microphones were activated<\/strong> for purposes other than the video calls themselves to receive classes.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, these same educational tools were endorsed and recommended by the educational authorities themselves (sometimes even developed), so no one distrusted the treatment that would be given to their privacy.<\/p>\n<h2>The Ministry of Education in the spotlight<\/h2>\n<p>Our country has the dishonor of appearing in said investigation.  More specifically, four applications promoted by both state and regional governments have been exposed in the report. <strong>A state platform of the Ministry of Education, two websites of the Generalitat of Catalonia and one of the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Starting with the state platform, the Ministry of Education is responsible for the Aprendo en Casa website, which was created with the aim of channeling quality educational resources, tools and applications available to teachers, families and students themselves.  The investigation found in their code that two ad trackers were sending children&#8217;s data to Google through the domains google-analytics.com and googletagmanager.com.  The privacy policy, however, only announced the use of Google Analytics for web analytics purposes.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1679955\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Web Learning at home<\/p>\n<p>The Ministry currently headed by Pilar Alegr\u00eda (Isabel Cela\u00e1 at the time of closure at the start of the pandemic) assures, however, that \u201cthere was no possibility of sharing data, since there was no data to share.  The data of the students did not have the ministry either.  The students did not enter with a user, they did not identify themselves and they did not offer their data to anyone [ni al ministerio ni a Google]\u00ab.<\/p>\n<h2>Andalusia and Catalonia also used trackers<\/h2>\n<p>Traveling to the south of the country, the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda promoted the eLearning platform among Andalusian educational centers.  Here, too, two ad trackers were found that were sending children&#8217;s data to Google.

In EDU365 there were ad trackers that sent through the domains google-analytics.com and googletagmanager.com.  For Super 3, they were submitted to Adobe via adobedtm.com, demdex.net, everesttech.net, and omtrdc.net and to Siteimprove via siteimproveanalytics.io and siteimproveanalytics.com.<\/p>\n<p>The Generalitat also wanted to qualify these results: \u00abThe portal is anonymous, public, without authentication and with static information, that is, without exchange of information or any database.  The infrastructure provider has analyzed the entire ecosystem (machines) with which EDU365 interacts and at this time has not found any file containing personal data.  The corporate Google Analytics account used by EDU365 has features for advertisers turned off.
