Thanks to a series of algorithms, we will be able to compress all kinds of files to save a lot of space on our hard drives, and best of all, it does so without hardly affecting the general performance of the system.<\/p>\n<h2>This is how the compact.exe command works<\/h2>\n<p>The first thing we have to take into account to use compact.exe is that we will have to do it through the Windows Console or, as it is known, CMD.  This console generally tends to throw many users back without much computer knowledge, mainly because of its interface and the syntax that must be used <strong>they are not exactly simple<\/strong>.  Of course, all you have to do is follow very specific steps to do things as useful as this compact.exe without fear of doing any damage to your computer.<\/p>\n<p>To access this console we only have to write the word CMD in the Windows search engine, or if you prefer, press the keyboard shortcut Windows + R and write CMD in the window that appears.  Once we have the black window open, we will have to write the necessary syntax to use this command. <strong>Let&#8217;s separate the explanation into two parts<\/strong> to make it easier to use: a base with the word \u201ccompact\u201d on one side, and on the other with the use of the exe parameter, which is what really interests us.<\/p>\n<p>The first part we need to understand is the beginning of the syntax for compression, and for that <strong>we will first use the word \u201ccompact\u201d<\/strong>.  Along with this we have several options to use and that will vary the compression process, such as the \/i command, which will make the process continue to the end omitting all kinds of errors, or the \/f command, which forces the compression of all the files that are in the path that we mark.  Other very important ones are c\/ and s\/, as we will see below.<\/p>\n<p>If, for example, we want all the files found in the \u201ctest\u201d folder in the root of our C hard drive to be compressed, the syntax that we must write in the console would be as in the following image:<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>The importance of the c\/ command is because it is in charge of commanding to compress, and <strong>the \/s command<\/strong> is used for <strong>send that compression to a certain directory<\/strong>.  Once we understand how this command works, we have to talk about the second part, which is really the interesting one.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The \/exe command<\/strong> is in charge of selecting the compression algorithm for our files.  As we say, this compression is really interesting because it does not affect the performance of our computer, since in fact the decompression of these takes place at the same time as their execution.<strong> There are 4 types of algorithms<\/strong>, which will range from the one that compresses the files the least (and therefore, is faster) to the one that does the most compression.  They are the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>XPRESS4K<\/li>\n<li>XPRESS8K<\/li>\n<li>XPRESS16K<\/li>\n<li>LZX<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The algorithm that uses this command by default is the first of all<\/strong>, since generally this is enough to save us a lot of space without affecting the performance of our equipment.  If we want to use another, such as XPRESS8K, it will suffice to enter the following syntax:<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1658730\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652847573_827_Use-compactexe-the-Windows-magic-command-to-reclaim-space.jpg\" alt=\"compact 2\" width=\"715\" height=\"406\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>As we said, this type of file compression works great, although sometimes it can affect the performance of very specific things such as video games.  If you use it and you are not satisfied, you can always go back and <strong>unzip the files to how they were before<\/strong>.  For this we only have to <strong>use the \/u command<\/strong>although if we have used exe compression we will also have to indicate the \/exe parameter.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This command, available in both Windows 10 and Windows 11, is one of the best file compression solutions we can find.
