Not only because of its attractive range of colors and premium-looking finishes, but because of how light it is.  We are used to mobiles weighing a lot, which can hinder their maneuverability, but instead this Xiaomi<strong> It weighs only 158 grams and its thickness is 6.81 millimeters.<\/strong>which makes it very comfortable and ergonomic for one-handed use.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1518174\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">11 Lite 5G New Edition<\/p>\n<p>And yet, the weight is not at odds with the size and it features a 6.55-inch screen, <strong>FullHD+ resolution<\/strong> and support for HDR10 +, which make the experience with this mobile more than pleasant, all taking into account the reduced price.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we are not only facing a simply beautiful mobile, but it has a fairly good performance, especially for its price.  Inside we find a <strong>Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G<\/strong>, a processor that is in the upper-middle range but with premium features.  It uses six-nanometer manufacturing technology (which ensures good temperature control) and also integrates an Adreno 642L GPU.  Of course, if you want it to play for many hours, keep in mind that it has a 90 Hz refresh rate and not 120 Hz.<\/p>\n<h2>Triple camera and 65 megapixels<\/h2>\n<p>This smartphone presents the characteristic halo of Xiaomi with a triple camera integrated in the same module.  The main sensor of this device is 65 megapixels, the focal aperture is f\/1.79, offering good detail and definition in the photos.  In addition, it has a <strong>8 megapixel ultra-wide sensor<\/strong> that has a great capacity to cover the surface that is going to be photographed.  The latest 5-megapixel sensor is the macro, for very close-ups, capable of capturing details that are almost imperceptible to the eye.<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1436550\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1436550\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653737771_33_The-lightest-5G-on-the-market-arrives-at-a-new.jpg\" alt=\"11Lite 5G\" width=\"715\" height=\"358\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1436550\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Xiaomi 11 Lite 5G NE rear camera detail<\/p>\n<p>As for the battery, the usual in almost all smartphones:<strong> 4250mAh capacity<\/strong>, and importantly this, with the option to fast charge at 33W.  From Xiaomi they guarantee up to 104 hours of video playback, and good optimization and duration in games.  With that amperage it is autonomous enough to get through the day with normal use, if not more.<\/p>\n<p>This terminal also has protection against water <strong>IP53<\/strong>something that will make you always be an excellent companion.<\/p>\n<p>In this Amazon offer, the model with 8 GB RAM + 128 GB ROM configuration lowers its price from 399 euros that it cost a few months ago to more than interesting<strong> 260 euros<\/strong>.  There are four eye-catching colors to choose from: peach pink, snowflake white, bubblegum blue and truffle black.<\/p>\n<p>The articles listed contain an affiliate link that reports to ADSLZone a small commission for each purchase.
