However, through agreements with third parties, there are still some ways to get Disney Plus for free on a temporary basis.<\/p>\n<h2>How to get free Disney Plus<\/h2>\n<p>As we said, there are several ways to get Disney Plus for free, especially in 30-day trial trials.  We are going to share some of the ways to get Disney + for free that currently work.<\/p>\n<h3>Through Xbox Game Pass<\/h3>\n<p>If you have Xbox or PC, with the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription you can enjoy Disney +.  Indeed, you would have to pay for the subscription to the video game store service, but if you already are, among its added benefits you can request the 30-day trial from the Rewards\/Advantages tab.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1662291\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Disney Plus on Xbox Game Pass<\/p>\n<p>Once in that section, along with downloadable content for video games and a subscription to Discord Nitro, you will find the free trial to Disney+, which will take you directly to the link where you will have to subscribe to enjoy this benefit.  It should be noted that it is only valid for new subscriptions to Disney + (you would have to cancel the subscription if you only want to try) and that it can only be redeemed once on each Xbox Game Pass account.<\/p>\n<h3>As a benefit for Movistar customers<\/h3>\n<p>In a similar way to the previous one, it will not be a way to get it 100% free, but it will be at no additional cost.  Movistar Fusi\u00f3n customers have Disney+ included as part of their rate contract.<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1662267\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1662267\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652967505_266_how-to-get-it-what-works-and-what-doesnt.jpg\" alt=\"Disney Plus on Movistar\" width=\"715\" height=\"327\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1662267\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Disney Plus on Movistar<\/p>\n<p>Before, Movistar Plus+ only gave the option to watch the thematic channel: Movistar Disney+.  However, the operator has removed this channel from its grid to offer an account with which you can directly access the Disney + platform.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that you must have activated your Disney+ account to be able to see the contents, if you have not activated it yet, click on the activation link.  You will have access to Disney if you are a client of any of these rates, those that have a fiction package.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>miMovistar Fiction.<\/li>\n<li>miMovistar Fiction with Netflix.<\/li>\n<li>Fusion Selection with Fiction.<\/li>\n<li>Full Fusion Plus.<\/li>\n<li>Total Fusion Plus 4 lines.<\/li>\n<li>Full Fusion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of becoming a customer now, this is a legacy benefit, so new subscribers only get 50% off for 3 months.<\/p>\n<h3>With the savings of the annual subscription<\/h3>\n<p>The price of Disney Plus right now is 8.99 euros per month (at launch it cost 6.99 euros).  However, this is not the only way to subscribe and there is another even cheaper one.<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1662297\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1662297\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652967505_216_how-to-get-it-what-works-and-what-doesnt.jpg\" alt=\"Disney + subscription prices\" width=\"715\" height=\"327\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1662297\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Disney + subscription prices<\/p>\n<p>Disney + also has an annual subscription whose price is 89.99 euros (before 69.99 euros).  Thus, <strong>by paying the equivalent of 10 months, you get two free<\/strong> every time you subscribe to the annual period.  Once again, it is not something free and legal that you will be able to enjoy without paying a single euro, but it is an additional benefit to get free months after paying something.<\/p>\n<h3>Get gift cards<\/h3>\n<p>There are several websites and apps whose platform operation gives the possibility of<strong> redeem points and accumulated money in different ways<\/strong>.  They usually reward you for filling out surveys, playing video games, watching ads, and more that reward time wasting with small cumulative payments.<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1662270\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1662270\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652967505_371_how-to-get-it-what-works-and-what-doesnt.jpg\" alt=\"Disney+ gift cards\" width=\"715\" height=\"327\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1662270\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">gift cards<\/p>\n<p>Once a certain amount is obtained, it can be exchanged in a variety of formats, among which are the<strong> Disney+ gift cards<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Some examples are Ysense, Offers2Cash, Dichotomic or RocketGPT.  Once earned, you will need to redeem them at disneyplus.com\/redeem.  Some of them also allow (and it can be more profitable) to exchange internal currencies in other payment methods such as PayPal balance and use that to buy Disney + subscriptions without actually leaving a penny from your bank account.<\/p>\n<h2>Methods that no longer work<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on where and when you consult, you may find other alternatives to get Disney + for free without working right now.  To save you from wasting time on something that is not going to come to fruition, we are going to review some of the methods that no longer work.<\/p>\n<p>The first of them is the own <strong>free trial offered by the platform<\/strong>.  Since Disney + was launched in Spain in 2020, it had a free trial period of 7 days, enough for you to take a look at its catalog and decide if you wanted to subscribe paying or not.<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1662273\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1662273\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652967505_43_how-to-get-it-what-works-and-what-doesnt.jpg\" alt=\"old free trial\" width=\"715\" height=\"374\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1662273\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">old free trial<\/p>\n<p>These free trial periods were<strong> limited to an email address and a single payment method<\/strong>.  As is often the case, &#8220;the law is made, the cheat is made&#8221;, so having free Disney+ could be unlimited as many times as you had email addresses and credit or debit cards.  In the end, the Mickey Mouse company aborted the possibility of having this alternative and it is no longer possible.<\/p>\n<p>To close this review of the methods that work and those that do not, we are going to ask you to be very careful about scams related to Disney+ free trials.  Some websites like https:\/\/www.disneyplusfreetrial.com\/es\/ (we do not link to them, because they are fraudulent) seem to replicate the design that the platform had when it still offered the free trial period, but they will redirect you to other websites where Your personal data will be stolen.  Don&#8217;t trust free Disney Plus card and code generators either.  They don&#8217;t work and can be dangerous.<\/p>\n<h2>Disney Plus free in other countries<\/h2>\n<p>Once we have reviewed the situation in Spain to get Disney Plus for free, we do have to say that not all countries have the same operation.  For example, in some Latin American countries the 7-day free trial is still offered.<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1662306\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1662306\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652967505_894_how-to-get-it-what-works-and-what-doesnt.jpg\" alt=\"disney plus mobile\" width=\"715\" height=\"327\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1662306\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Free annual subscription on Verizon<\/p>\n<p>There are other companies that also allow their customers to get different <strong>free trials for Disney Plus as part of their loyalty programs<\/strong>.  For example, users of MercadoLibre, a trading platform, can get up to 6 months of Disney+ totally free.  One for each loyalty level they reach.<\/p>\n<p>Companies like <strong>Verizon<\/strong> offer a similar offer to Movistar.  Fios or 5G rate customers will have a free year of subscription to the streaming platform as part of their rates.  In Mexico with Izzy, Telmex and Telcel also offer this reward to their telephone customers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since a time ago, There is no longer an official Disney+ free trial, so the only thing you can do is pay 8.99 euros of the monthly subscription if you want to see if the catalog and its operation convinces you.
