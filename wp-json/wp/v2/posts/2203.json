We all try to get away for a few days during these months to enjoy with family and friends, so we tend to move outside our homes.  The big operators, as is the case with Movistar, are very aware of this and that is why they launch very interesting promotions every summer.  The blue operator, in fact, has thrown the house out the window, <strong>and now your mobile rates look better than ever<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Movistar is always &#8220;struggling&#8221; to offer everyone the best rates and services.  The arrival of miMovistar has meant a leap in quality in terms of convergent offer, giving the consumer the possibility of manufacturing a tariff to suit him.  Now the focus is on mobile rates, and Movistar offers us<strong> all your contract rates at half price for 3 months <\/strong>for new highs and portability.<\/p>\n<h2>All rates, half price<\/h2>\n<p>We are going to take the opportunity to refresh your memory with the mobile offers that the blue operator has in its catalog.  Regarding contract rates, the operator has 3 available that are quite interesting.  The first of them is the simplest, although it has little of that.  this, called <strong>Contract L<\/strong>, offers unlimited calls and 8 GB of data for us to use as we want.  Normally, this rate has a price of 14.95 euros per month, but now we can enjoy it for three months <strong>for only 7.48 euros<\/strong> (VAT included).<\/p>\n<p>We make a fairly big jump to the second of these tariffs, called <strong>XL Contract<\/strong>.  This differs from the previous one only in the amount of data it offers, and instead of settling for doubling these, it adds some more.  Specifically, this XL has 30 GB of data and now we can hire it <strong>for 12.48 euros per month<\/strong> (regular price 24.95 euros).  Both rates have two additional services in common that are included: Secure Connection and Movistar Cloud.<\/p>\n<p>The rate that we lack offers us the best of the best, and now at an irresistible price.  this, called <strong>Infinity Contract<\/strong>, comes with, as you can imagine, both unlimited calls and gigabytes.  The usual price to contract it is 39.95 euros per month, and now we can take it for <strong>19.98 euros for three months<\/strong>.  In addition to the two services that already have the above rates, the Infinite Contract includes a Movistar Plus+ Lite account.  It should be noted that the three rates <strong>they do not have any type of permanence<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>If by any chance what you are looking for is a prepaid rate, we also have good news for you.  Movistar currently offers three of its rates with more gigabytes of data for the same price.  We have <strong>Total Prepayment<\/strong> (95 GB for 20 euros), <strong>Premium Prepaid<\/strong> (50 GB for 15 euros) and <strong>Prepaid Plus<\/strong> (30 GB for 10 euros).  The three prepaid rates include unlimited national calls.<\/p>\n<h2>Take the opportunity to take an additional line<\/h2>\n<p>As we said, these fantastic discounts that you have above apply to mobile lines, but if what you were looking for is to take one of these promotions with Movistar Fusi\u00f3n or miMovistar, you should know that you also have that possibility.  The operator has put the same three rates that it offers at a brutal price for the next 3 months, and being within its convergent offer <strong>they will be even cheaper<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In this way, until May 31 we will be able to do it for three months with <strong>an additional Line L for 3.95 euros per month<\/strong>with <strong>an XL Line for 7.45 euros per month<\/strong> and with <strong>an infinite line<\/strong> at the most magnificent price of <strong>\u20ac9.95 per month<\/strong>.  Don&#8217;t miss the opportunity to get one of these offers while they are available.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Now that we are ending the month of May, we already have summer just around the corner.
