This is precisely one of the main advantages that Movistar Plus+ Lite has, since, as we will see just below, <strong>it hardly has requirements to enjoy all its content<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>What does Movistar Plus+ Lite offer?<\/h2>\n<p>This service is a great alternative to the more traditional streaming platforms, since in addition to offering us access to series or movies, it also allows us to watch<strong> programs of all kinds and even sporting events<\/strong>.  The platform offers both live channels and on-demand content, also including original content from Movistar Plus+ and a large number of movies and series along with all the sports that are broadcast on #Vamos.<\/p>\n<p>Another common point of Lite with respect to other streaming platforms and that is worth reviewing is <strong>the large number of devices that are compatible with it<\/strong>.  In addition to, obviously, being able to enjoy all its content comfortably in our browser, we can also do it on all kinds of mobile devices (both Android and iOS), on LG or Samsung Smart TVs, or even on Chromecast or Amazon Fire TV.  Also, it allows <strong>playback on two screens simultaneously<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As for the plans it offers, the truth is that its operation is identical to other streaming platforms.  Movistar Plus+ Lite only offers a monthly subscription model that has a price of <strong>8 euros<\/strong>, and it does not have any type of associated permanence, so we can unsubscribe at any time.  Hiring this service <strong>also includes a mobile phone line without any fee<\/strong>so we will have to pay for it according to the use we give it.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1584459\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">All these channels are on Movistar Plus+ Lite.<\/p>\n<h2>Ways to get it for free or cheaper<\/h2>\n<p>We have already told you a little above that Movistar Plus + Lite has a price of 8 euros per month, without the possibility of getting a larger subscription to save something per month.  However, there are some ways to get hold of it.<strong> without having to pay those 8 euros<\/strong>and also to take it away cheaper.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>With one of the rates that offer it<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Above we have told you that to contract Lite it is not necessary to be a client, but the operator has some rates in its catalog that <strong>include subscription to the platform totally free<\/strong>.  If we get hold of one of them, we can enjoy Movistar Plus+ Lite totally free without having to pay 8 euros a month.  If we were paying it and we contracted one of these rates, Movistar offers the possibility of continuing to use the same account, although for this we will have to wait until the 1st of the following month.  According to the Movistar website, the rates that include Movistar Plus+ Lite are: Contract 20 plus, Rate #25, Rate #15 or Infinite Contract.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Take advantage of recurring discounts<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Another point to keep in mind with Movistar Plus+ Lite is that it is continuously offering <strong>very interesting discounts<\/strong>.  If we take a look at the service at the time of writing these lines, it is possible to sign up and enjoy all the content until June 30 for only 8 euros, so we would no longer be saving money.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use a promotional code<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Both Movistar and other companies are continuously offering promotional codes.  It is not difficult to do a quick search on the Internet to find one that is active, although yes, <strong>these are always for new accounts<\/strong>.  To activate these codes, all we have to do is go to the Movistar Plus+ Lite page, click to create an account, and in this window we will be shown the steps to be able to use said code.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Share account with another person<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We have already told you above: Lite allows you to watch with the same account <strong>content on two different screens at once<\/strong>.  This is nothing new, as all streaming platforms offer this possibility with a different number of screens.  In this way, you can contract the service and agree with a friend to divide the monthly payment between them.  You can also share the account that offers one of the rates that we have told you about a little above.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is important that we do not confuse the classic Movistar Plus+ service with this Lite version, since only the operator&#8217;s customers have access to the former.
