Result: the average cost of a ticket in Spain is 53 euros, in Italy&#8217;s Serie A 48, in the Premier League 44 and in the Bundesliga 30. With the minimum wages -and not so minimum wages- that we have in Spain, the current unemployment situation, and the difference in purchasing power with other European countries calls attention to this inequality. I found it curious, to say the least, to see how a ticket for a 2\u00aaB Oviedo-La Roda match costs 25 euros, while the Champions League Leverkusen-Bar\u00e7a match could be seen from 15 euros.<\/p>\n<table class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Different prices depending on the rival <\/i><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>The reporters wonder why this price madness in Spain, and conclude:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The schedules are not conducive to going to the stadiums.
