With this, you will have at your total disposal more than a thousand free live online television channels available and you will be able to enjoy them from your smartphone, laptop, desktop PC, Android TV and almost any platform with a browser at hand.  The number of channels is constantly changing, as new ones arrive but others are also lost.<\/p>\n<h2>How does it work<\/h2>\n<p>The operation is very simple: Photocall.tv is not a page <strong>to watch TV for free, but<\/strong> that it is a website that compiles all the channels that we can see through the Internet and orders and organizes them so that you find everything at the first time.  For example, you want to see news from Andalusia on the Internet: you go to Photocall TV and search the different Andalusian or local channels for what you are looking for.  The advantage here is that<strong> we will not have to change the web,<\/strong> but we can do a review or zap for all without having to know the pages of each one by heart.<\/p>\n<p>The interface is very simple.  At the top we find several sections: national, international, other, radio.  Here we can choose the one that interests us and the screen will be filled with channel logos of all kinds.  Some are easily recognizable as Antena 3 or La Sexta, but there are many other channels that you have never heard of (and that we will tell you about in the next paragraphs) When you have chosen the one you want, you click on it.  If there is only one option to view it, <strong>takes us directly to your website<\/strong> so you can see the live at that time.  But there are others that allow us several options.  For example, we may be able to choose whether to watch it in Spanish or English or if we want to watch it from a specific platform (such as Pluto TV) In that case, you choose the one you want and the corresponding website will open so you can see the image .<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<h2>How to access<\/h2>\n<p>Where to see?  It is a web page that <strong>allows you to play it automatically from the browser<\/strong> from the computer so we will have no problem watching TV for free and any browser.  It works correctly in browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But we can also see it from tablets and mobile phones without any problem, using the browser you have on your phone.  What happen?  That what Photocall does is <strong>refer us to live television websites<\/strong> what are we gonna see.  For example, we go to see Neox and it redirects us to Atresplayer.  That is why it will not depend so much on Photocalltv itself as on the channel that we want to watch.  According to our tests, it works perfectly on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.  But, as we say, it will depend on each of the channels and websites.<\/p>\n<h2>All the channels<\/h2>\n<p>In total, more than 200 national channels, more than 400 international channels and many thematic channels are offered, in addition to radio channels. <strong>The vast majority are open channels<\/strong> that can be seen through its website, although there are some exceptions, in the \u201cothers\u201d section, with payment channels.<\/p>\n<p>But we recommend that you only use Photocall.tv <strong>as a directory that helps you to see all the open channels<\/strong> from a single website and without going from one to another.  We can filter the channels from several options: national, international, other, radio&#8230; In total, there are practically all the channels that we can see on television, whether they are general, cartoon, regional&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3>General channels:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>the 1<\/li>\n<li>the 2<\/li>\n<li>Antenna 3<\/li>\n<li>Four<\/li>\n<li>Telecinco<\/li>\n<li>The sixth<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Other DTT channels<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>24 hours<\/li>\n<li>TDP<\/li>\n<li>Clan<\/li>\n<li>neox<\/li>\n<li>Not going<\/li>\n<li>Mega<\/li>\n<li>A3S<\/li>\n<li>Fiction Factory<\/li>\n<li>Energy<\/li>\n<li>BeMAD<\/li>\n<li>divinity<\/li>\n<li>MTMad<\/li>\n<li>Boing<\/li>\n<li>Secret Story<\/li>\n<li>dkiss<\/li>\n<li>DMAD<\/li>\n<li>Paramount Network<\/li>\n<li>Thirteen<\/li>\n<li>The Bull Intereconomy<\/li>\n<li>7NN<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>regional and local<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>All the autonomous channels of Spain can be seen from Photocall.tv regardless of where you are.

This is fantastic if we want to enjoy the app on a mobile phone, a computer or a tablet, but <strong>it can be somewhat more tedious if we want to do it on a television<\/strong>.  Smart TVs all have the possibility of accessing a browser, but if we do not have one at home, but if a Chromecast (or similar, such as Amazon&#8217;s Fire TV Stick) there is a much better and easier way to watch PhotoCall TV on our television.<\/p>\n<p>To do this, we will only have to download and install the application for mobile devices Web Video Cast.  The function of this application is, as you can imagine, that of <strong>transmit the signal from the browser directly to the Chromecast<\/strong>.  It is enough to install the application on our device and have it connected to the same network that we have our Chromecast.  The application basically contains a browser that will allow us to search for PhotoCall TV from there, and once we have selected the channel we want to watch here, we will only have to press the Transmit button next to the upper URL bar to search for our Chromecast by your name.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1525182 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653092444_182_See-DTT-channels-on-the-Internet.jpg\" alt=\"Web Videocast\" width=\"715\" height=\"422\"  \/>Download Web Video Cast on Android |  Download Web Video Cast on iOS<\/p>\n<h2>Watch football for free live<\/h2>\n<p>For example, if what you want is to enjoy the Spanish football competition, La Liga, the only way to watch it on this platform would be <strong>through Goal TV.<\/strong> This is because the television rights belong to Movistar in its entirety and, from its pay channels, it is where the matches are broadcast.
