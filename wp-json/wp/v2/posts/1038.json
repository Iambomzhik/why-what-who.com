In this sense, the consumption of movies and series in streaming, listening to music through platforms and online gaming imply a large use of data, actions that, moreover, occur simultaneously from the devices of the different users of the house \u00bb.<\/p>\n<p>The combination of WiFi 6 + new maximum speed will have <strong>an extra cost of 9.99 euros per month on the price of the usual rate<\/strong> for all current private customers.
