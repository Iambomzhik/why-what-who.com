But, is it an effective remedy to lose weight or does it make no sense to take it?  Experts make it clear.<\/p>\n<p>On the internet we can find countless diets to lose weight and all kinds of tricks to lose weight.  However, much of this information circulating on the net is not true and promises miraculous results that never come. <\/p>\n<p>Now, a new formula to lose weight quickly and easily has gone viral on TikTok. <strong>We talk about coffee with lemon,<\/strong> a combination that according to various users of the video social network is effective for losing weight. <\/p>\n<p>As they explain on Fox News, <strong>this trend was started in early 2021 from a fake video.<\/strong> This clip, which has since been removed (although traces remain online), featured manipulated footage of Dr. Brian Boxe Wachler, a Beverly Hills ophthalmologist who is popular for his reactions to health-related claims.<\/p>\n<p>In the fake video it seemed that this doctor supported the claim that drinking coffee with lemon helps burn fat and lose weight, which led many people to think that this remedy helps to lose weight. <strong>But what is true about this trend?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The results of a study reveal that this type of tea helps you lose weight while you sleep, with the advantage that it does not interfere with the quality of your sleep.<\/p>\n<p>What the experts say is that <strong>drinking coffee with lemon does not help you lose weight<\/strong>but it is nothing more than a myth.  Losing weight is a process that requires you to consume fewer calories than you burn, so it doesn&#8217;t just happen by magically drinking something.<\/p>\n<p>Dietitian Erin Palinski-Wade explains that adding lemon to coffee, like drinking lemon water, doesn&#8217;t have a direct impact on body weight.  However,<strong> What is certain is that drinking hot drinks without calories can promote a feeling of satiety,<\/strong> making you eat less and, therefore, you can lose weight.  &#8220;But it&#8217;s not the lemon that causes the weight loss,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that <strong>abusing the mixture of coffee and lemon can have harmful effects on health.<\/strong> This is because, consumed in large proportions, the citric acid in lemons can damage tooth enamel and the lining of the esophagus, as well as cause heartburn. <\/p>\n<p>And we all know the negative effects of drinking too much coffee, such as headaches, rapid heart rate, difficulty sleeping, and even brain problems.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Drinking coffee with lemon juice is the new slimming recipe that is spreading on TikTok.
