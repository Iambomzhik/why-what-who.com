With everything and with it the most used and popular proposal of the moment and for years is <strong>Microsoft PowerPoint<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>This is a program that, as many of you already know, is part of the <strong>Office office suite<\/strong>.  Perhaps it can be considered as the most creative of the different solutions that we find in this suite thanks to everything that it offers us.  As we mentioned, this is a software especially focused on the design of slide-based presentations.  The most striking thing that we find in this section is that we can use a multitude of elements.<\/p>\n<p>Possibly one of the most important components of any <strong>presentation<\/strong> be the texts that compose it.  But PowerPoint allows us to add many other objects such as images, videos, tables, graphs and much more.  In addition, we can customize and adapt all of this depending on what we are looking for in our project.  It must be borne in mind that one of the main objectives of these presentations is usually <strong>draw the attention of the public<\/strong>.  Hence, it also has enormous importance in our creativity when designing these documents.<\/p>\n<p>Along these same lines, we want to talk about a useful function that will allow you to save a huge amount of time and obtain spectacular results in your PowerPoint presentations.  Specifically, we refer to the <strong>feature called Quick Styles<\/strong> that this program offers us.  These allow us to establish a much more striking design than the one we could make by hand, and in a few seconds.<\/p>\n<h2>Apply quick styles in PowerPoint to save time<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to all the additional elements that we can integrate into our presentation slides here, we have multiple customization features.  This is precisely where our patience and creativity come into play when it comes to <strong>design these multimedia documents<\/strong>.  But it can also be the case that we need to achieve attractive results in a few minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, the very <strong>microsoft<\/strong> try to make things easy for us.  For this, it precisely proposes a series of predefined elements and styles that we can use in the designs.  A clear example of all this can be found in the aforementioned <strong>quick styles<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>Actually, here we refer to a series of combinations that host different options for both colors and formats that we can apply to the elements of the presentation in a matter of seconds.  To do this we only have to mark the object or shape that we want to modify and go to the Start menu option of <strong>PowerPoint<\/strong>.  Here, in the section called Drawing, we find the button that interests us.<\/p>\n<p>We will see one called Quick Styles that is displayed to show us a<strong> good amount of predefined styles that we can apply<\/strong> directly on the marked shape or object.  This will save us a good amount of time and effort as we will be able to <strong>use predefined layouts<\/strong> by Microsoft itself and that will surely be very apparent to us.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-764418\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653735345_685_Save-time-and-effort-with-PowerPoint-Quick-Styles.jpg\" alt=\"quick powerpoint styles\" width=\"488\" height=\"860\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>They may not have the originality that other styles that we define ourselves may have, but if we are in a hurry, this is a more than interesting option.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If what we need is to design our own multimedia presentation, whether it is for a professional job, related to education, or personal, we have plenty of software to choose from.
