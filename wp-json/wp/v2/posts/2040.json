Its interface is entirely in English, so it is a small handicap that we must accept if we want to use it, since there is no possibility of changing the language.  The first thing we will find will be an information message indicating that it will be necessary to activate it to keep the protection updated.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<h3>Scan all devices<\/h3>\n<p>At the bottom of the screen we find the Scan button, a section from where you can perform different types of scanning.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fast<\/strong>: is responsible for scanning the critical areas of the system that can become infected by viruses and spyware.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Complete<\/strong>: Performs a scan of the entire computer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Personalized<\/strong>: we can define which specific folders or drives we want to perform the scan.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Rootkit scanning<\/strong>: scans the system for malicious files that may be hidden on the computer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Along with the scan options, we also find different configuration options, schedule scans and manage the schedule scan.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-724791 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653313850_823_K7-Total-Security-PC-protection-against-viruses-malware-and-spyware.jpg\" alt=\"K7 Total Security Scan\" width=\"900\" height=\"649\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3>Additional tools<\/h3>\n<p>At the bottom we also find the Tools section, where we can access additional and relevant features of this security system.  Here we must spend some time to see all the options that we have available.<\/p>\n<p>For example, we can use <strong>SecureDelete<\/strong> to delete more important files in such a way that no data recovery software can recover them.  This can be useful for deleting plain original texts or encrypted documents.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-724794 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653313850_803_K7-Total-Security-PC-protection-against-viruses-malware-and-spyware.jpg\" alt=\"K7 Total Security Tools\" width=\"900\" height=\"649\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>We also find cleaning tools to improve the performance of the system, which may not be entirely useful since Windows is already in charge of carrying out the defragmentation of the system in the background and incorporates its own defragmentation tool.<\/p>\n<p>It also has the tool <strong>Computer Tune Up<\/strong> that promises to increase the performance and speed of the PC.  Upon startup, it reports adjusting memory, PCU, browser, and graphics settings.<\/p>\n<p>That is why of all the tools that we find, the most useful are those of <strong>USB Vaccination<\/strong> (vaccinate USB devices so they can&#8217;t be infected), Virtual Keyboard, along with Secure Delete.  The rest are probably more expendable and have no real value.<\/p>\n<h2>Download K7 Total Security<\/h2>\n<p>K7 Total Security is a commercial antivirus, so in order to use it, you will need to purchase its license.  We can test it previously by downloading its free trial version that has a <strong>duration of 30 days<\/strong>.
