The theory to achieve this is simple: you must consume fewer calories than you spend.  But if you want that weight loss to be effective and constant, you can&#8217;t do it by eye.  Did you know that there is a formula that tells you how many calories you should eat a day to lose weight?<\/p>\n<p>It is the first thing that nutritionists calculate when you go to their consultation.  You can do it yourself, to get an idea of \u200b\u200bthe calories that your body needs and those that you have to consume to lose weight.  But to obtain a more accurate assessment, it is always advisable to see a doctor or nutrition specialist.<\/p>\n<p>To know <strong>how many calories should you eat a day to lose weight, <\/strong>First we are going to <strong>calculate BMR or BMR<\/strong>and then calories based on various parameters.<\/p>\n<p>To lose weight you have to cut calories, but the problem is that <u>we need calories to stay alive<\/u>.  Breathing, digesting or circulating blood through the veins requires calories.  If we consume less than what our body needs for its vital functions, it can remove them from the muscles, instead of fats.<\/p>\n<p>That is why the first thing we have to<strong> <\/strong>calculate is<strong> the BMR or TMB<\/strong>that is, the <strong>Basal Metabolic Rate<\/strong>.  They are the calories that we consume at rest, without doing anything.  Those that our body needs to live.  Varies based on age, weight, height, etc.  There are several <strong>formulas to calculate the BMR<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Certain dishes cannot be eaten every day and in some cases they are only available to a few.  These are the most expensive foods in the world.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to do it automatically, many scales include sensors that launch electrodes at our body, to calculate the BMR.  Check out these body analysis scales from Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to calculate it manually, <strong>the formula to calculate the BMR or TMB<\/strong> best known is <strong>the Harris\u2013Benedict equation<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Men: BMR = 66 + (13.7 x weight in kg) + (5 x height in cm) &#8211; (6.75 x age in years)<\/li>\n<li>Women: BMR = 655 + (9.6 x weight in kg) + (1.8 x height in cm) &#8211; (4.7 x age in years)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For example, if we want to calculate the BMR of a woman who weighs 72 kilos, measures 1.65 meters and is 32 years old, it would be:<\/p>\n<p>BMR = 655 + (9.6 x 72) + (1.8 x 165) &#8211; (4.7 x 32) = 655 + 691.2 + 297 &#8211; 150.4 = <u>1493 calories a day.<\/u> Those are the calories your body consumes at rest.<\/p>\n<p>There is a more modern formula called <strong>Mifflin-St equation.  Jeor<\/strong>, which you can apply in this online calculator.  The <strong>BMR or TMB<\/strong> It marks the calories at rest.  We have to multiply them by a number, according to our daily activity (valid for men and women):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>BMR x 1.2: Little or no exercise<\/li>\n<li>BMR x 1,375: Light exercise (1 to 3 days a week)<\/li>\n<li>BMR x 1.55: Moderate exercise (3 to 5 days a week)<\/li>\n<li>BMR x 1.72: Athlete (6 -7 days a week)<\/li>\n<li>BMR x 1.9: Athlete (morning and afternoon training)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the woman in our example does light exercise, she will need to apply the formula:<\/p>\n<p>BMR x 1.375 = 1493 x 1.375 =<u> 2052 calories.<\/u><\/p>\n<p>Those are the daily calories that keep you at your current weight.  To lose weight, you will need to consume fewer calories each day.  How many less?<\/p>\n<p>It is estimated that <u>To lose a kilo, you have to stop eating about 7,000 calories<\/u>.  A healthy way to lose weight is to lose half a kilo a week, that is, about 3,500 calories a week.  That&#8217;s 500 calories a day.<\/p>\n<p>Food labels are supposed to be easy to understand.  Sometimes because we misinterpret them, and sometimes because they are not at all clear, we make important mistakes when reading them.<\/p>\n<p>In our example, since this woman spends 2052 calories a day, she would have to look for a diet of 2052 &#8211; 500 = <u>1552 calories a day to lose a pound a week<\/u>, maintaining your current pace of life.
