However, for quite some time it has been possible to use these lines in devices of all kinds, in such a way that with them we can continue to enjoy both calls and the data that we have contracted.  For this, Vodafone&#8217;s OneNumber service is fantastic, and from today the users of some smartwatches <strong>they can enjoy it for free for three months<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>OneNumber may not be one of the most popular Vodafone services, but it is certainly very useful.  Thanks to it, we will be able to enjoy on our wearable everything that we have contracted with our rate, in addition to the same apps and services.  The best of all is that for this we will not need to have the mobile near the smartwatch, so <strong>we can leave our device at home<\/strong> and still continue making calls as if nothing happened.<\/p>\n<h2>Promotion valid only for these models<\/h2>\n<p>As we said, this promotion will offer three free months of OneNumber to all those users who have made or are going to make some smartwatches <strong>through Vodafone<\/strong>.  During these three months we will not have to pay absolutely anything to enjoy this service, and from the fourth month the price will be the usual price of the service, that is, 5 euros per month.  One Number does not have any type of permanence, so you can unsubscribe whenever you want. <strong>The smartwatches that benefit from this promotion are the following<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apple Watch Series 7: <\/strong>With GPS and Cellular, both in its 41mm and 45mm versions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Apple Watch SE: <\/strong>in both its 41mm and 45mm versions<\/li>\n<li><strong>Samsung GalaxyWatch 4: <\/strong>in its 40mm, 42mm, 44mm and 46mm versions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1679985\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Apple Watch Series 7.<\/p>\n<p>Although this OneNumber 3 months free promotion will only apply to users of these devices, <strong>Vodafone also offers a free month<\/strong> in case you have another of the smartwatches that it offers.  Both promotions will be applied automatically at the time of activating the service without the need to do anything.<\/p>\n<h2>So you can configure OneNumber on your smartwatch<\/h2>\n<p>The smartwatches in this list have a built-in e-SIM, so we will not need to insert any SIM card inside them.  Activating this OneNumber service is very simple, although it is a different process depending on which device we have with us.  Next, we give you the necessary details to be able to activate it, both with the Apple Watch and with the Samsung watch.<\/p>\n<h3>Activate OneNumber with your Apple Watch<\/h3>\n<p>iPhone phones have an app installed by default called Watch, and thanks to it we can synchronize our Apple Watch without much difficulty, since for this we will only have to <strong>place the watch in front of the phone camera<\/strong>.  After following some configuration steps, the option to configure mobile data will appear on the screen, and from here you will only have to do the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click on Configure mobile data<\/li>\n<li>sign in with <strong>your My Vodafone credentials<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>By doing so, you will ask us to activate the OneNumber service accepting the terms and conditions<\/li>\n<li>Once this is done, we will receive an SMS indicating that the service is active<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Activate OneNumber with your Galaxy Watch<\/h3>\n<p>To configure the Vodafone service on the Galaxy Watch 4 we must follow some steps that are a bit like the ones just above these lines, but with some differences.  Everything is done through the app <strong>Galaxy Wearables<\/strong>, where you will need to pair your watch.  Once this is done, follow the next steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selecting your device, select <strong>Mobile data<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Click on next<\/li>\n<li>You will need to enter the phone number that will be associated with OneNumber<\/li>\n<li><strong>You will receive an SMS with a PIN<\/strong>.  Enter it.<\/li>\n<li>In the new window, activate the service<\/li>\n<li>Enter the name of your device<\/li>\n<li>Click on Subscribe now<\/li>\n<li>To finish, click on Connect<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mobile lines have historically been used, of course, in our phones.
