With it, you get a model of <strong>Xiaomi<\/strong> that complies with this and that has several characteristics that make it an excellent purchase option.<\/p>\n<p>An example of what we say is that its connectivity is magnificent.  Apart from offering everything you need to access the Internet, such as <strong>WiFi and Ethernet port<\/strong>, you can find such interesting options as no less than three HDMI connections and the same number of USBs that you can use from consoles to sound bars.  Additionally, one of the most striking things about this Xiaomi Mi TV 4S is that it includes <strong>chrome cast<\/strong>so you can send content from smartphones conveniently and efficiently.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>As we have mentioned, the operating system is <strong>Android<\/strong>, with the corresponding customization used by the Asian firm (called PatchWall).  This allows you to install a large number of <strong>free apps<\/strong>, among which there is no lack of clients for streaming services, as well as games.  Besides, the user interface is very easy to operate with the remote control and, also, the synchronization with mobiles and other devices with Google&#8217;s operating system is fantastic.<\/p>\n<h2>This TV is ideal for multimedia content<\/h2>\n<p>We say this because it offers more than enough quality in both the image and sound sections.  In the first one you should know that the resolution that the panel has <strong>55 inches<\/strong> that the Xiaomi Mi TV 4S has reaches the resolution <strong>4K<\/strong>, so there are no movies or series that you can&#8217;t take full advantage of.  Taking into account that the panel is IPS and uses Direct LED backlighting, brightness and contrast enhancement technologies are included that allow content to be reproduced <strong>HDR10<\/strong> without the slightest difficulty.  Therefore, in principle, this model will meet all the expectations you may have.<\/p>\n<p>As far as the sound is concerned, things are not going as well, but they are by no means a disaster.  The power is <strong>20W<\/strong>, which is not crazy and you may have to resort to an advanced sound bar if you are very demanding in this section.  Additionally, this television offers here positive options such as compatibility with <strong>Dolby and DTS<\/strong> of your stereo system and also has Virtual Sound Surround to locate the points of effects in games.<\/p>\n<h2>More important things in this Xiaomi TV<\/h2>\n<p>To begin with, its design is quite attractive because it has very small frames, which allows it to have almost surprising dimensions (because they are scarce): <strong>767.3 x 1,231.6 x 264.2 millimeters<\/strong> with its two legs that it uses as bases.  Besides, it is interesting to mention that the USB ports allow you to record live broadcasts, so you won&#8217;t miss anything if you can&#8217;t be in front of the TV to watch them.  The truth is that taking into account the offer that exists right now on Amazon to buy this Xiaomi Mi TV 4S, which allows <strong>save 44%<\/strong>is one of the options that you should take into account to renew your Smart TV at a very reasonable price.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1671513\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653246495_614_With-Chromecast-and-55-this-Xiaomi-Smart-TV-on-sale.jpg\" alt=\"Side of the Xiaomi Mi TV 4S\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\"  \/>The articles listed contain an affiliate link that reports to ADSLZone a small commission for each purchase.
