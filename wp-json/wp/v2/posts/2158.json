Thanks to the morphology and operation that they offer us, the loss of packages is much more unlikely than through the direct downloads that we make from the browser.  On many occasions this type of use has been related to the world of content piracy.  But torrents and their use go much further, both at the end user and business level.<\/p>\n<p>For example, there are many companies that use these <strong>torrent<\/strong> to share their projects with both their clients and their workers.  And it is that they represent an effective and safe way to share large amounts of files, also in a simple way.  However, on certain occasions we can find some problems here.  Usually these are related to bugs <strong>upload or download content<\/strong>.  We must bear in mind that the clients that we use here, such as qBittorrent, have been configured from the outset by someone to use them from the first minute.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time we can meet and make use of a multitude of <strong>customizable functions and parameters to improve its performance<\/strong>.  With everything and with it, one of the most common problems that we can find in these programs is that we are going to download a Torrent and it does not have seeds.  At that point let&#8217;s see what we can do.<\/p>\n<h2>What to do if my downloads are seedless in qBittorrent<\/h2>\n<p>Surely many of you already know that, in this type of download, the <strong>seeds available to extract and share the files<\/strong> they are keys.  This means that the more seeds or users are sharing the same Torrent file, possibly the sooner we get hold of it.  This makes the <strong>P2P networks<\/strong> be very interesting for certain communities of users who are followers of collaborative work.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>On the contrary, we can find that a certain file that we load in the qBittorrent client has zero seeds.  At this point we could ask ourselves if that file we want to do with is completely missing.  Well, we should know that if <strong>a torrent file shows zero seeds<\/strong> he is generally said to be dead.  But this is something that cannot be confirmed in 100% of situations of this type.  This means that, if you find yourself in this situation, the first thing to do is <strong>update the trackers<\/strong> from the program, in this case qBittorrent.<\/p>\n<p>Once this is done we will have no choice but to wait to see if new seeds appear in the <strong>P2P client<\/strong> to be able to download the content as such.  In general, if the Torrent has updated trackers and has been running for a month, but without activity, we can say that the <strong>torrent has really disappeared<\/strong>.  This means that there is no one sharing the file that interests us, so we will not be able to get that content, at least for now.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Generally these clients to which we have referred and their corresponding networks are used for the downloading and uploading large files.
