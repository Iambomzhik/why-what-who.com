Whether for reasons related to education, personal growth, or work, many start programming their own projects.  One of the points that we must be clearer in this regard is where we want to go, that is, what type of software we want to develop.<\/p>\n<p>We can opt for the <strong>creation of programs<\/strong> own for PC, mobile applications, be part of large development projects, or even <strong>create games<\/strong>.  It is precisely this last section that we want to talk about in these lines.  Thanks to the enormous success of PC games at the moment, many are launching into the development of their own creations.  But as you can imagine this is not something that can be considered as simple, at least initially.<\/p>\n<p>And it is that there are many who want to enter this sector of software development, but who do not have knowledge about programming code.  Obviously those who know some languages \u200b\u200band have previous experience, will be able to enter the <strong>development of their own games<\/strong> no problem.  But at the same time there are many users who do not have this knowledge, but still want to start in this world.  Therefore, we will tell you that we can use certain <strong>platforms and applications<\/strong> that allow us to program our own games without having to type a single line of code.<\/p>\n<h2>Software to create games without knowing how to program<\/h2>\n<p>There are several platforms and software solutions that allow us to create games without knowing how to program, let&#8217;s see some of the most popular and used.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><strong>RPG Maker<\/strong>: here we find one of the most popular proposals in the sector.  We can acquire it through the Steam platform store and it is especially focused on RPG-type games.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GameMaker<\/strong>: This is another attractive alternative for these tasks that we mentioned related to game design.  Thus, the platform offers us both free and paid content so that we can generate our own projects of this type without programming.  Our imagination and creativity in this case plays a very important role.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Construct<\/strong>: the platform especially indicated for the creation of Construct games, it has not stopped growing and improving over time.  At this time they are going through their third version, we will have the possibility to give free rein to our imagination.  Although it is especially indicated for the development of platform games, we can make our way in other types.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stencyl<\/strong>: when creating video games without knowing how to program and if you like platform games, this is a great option.  One aspect to take into account and highlight is that we can create titles for all kinds of platforms, both mobile and desktop.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, then we have game development engines like <strong>Unity<\/strong> either <strong>Unreal Engine<\/strong>, among others.  However, these platforms require more advanced knowledge, although we will probably also obtain more professional results.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Precisely for all this, a multitude of users enter this sector, which is not exactly simple, but it does offer us multiple outlets and benefits.
