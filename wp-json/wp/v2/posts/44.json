How could it be otherwise, here we are going to find a large number of new functions and features that improve this popular program.<\/p>\n<p>We refer to the arrival of <strong>firefox100<\/strong> where Mozilla introduces a series of new features that you will surely love.  Precisely all of this we will talk about now so that you can get an idea of \u200b\u200beverything you will find when updating the application.<\/p>\n<h2>How to download and install Firefox 100<\/h2>\n<p>The first thing that we are going to tell you is that this renewed version in Windows is the first that is signed with <strong>SHA-256<\/strong>.  At the same time and similar to what happened with Chrome, some websites may not work due to a <strong>incorrect user agent parsing<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>But with everything and with it Mozilla already has a support page for users who find the <strong>compatibility issues<\/strong>.  Therefore, to download and install the new version of the software we only have to download the browser from its official website.  In the same way, we can update from the program itself by simply going to its Help \/ About Firefox menu option.  Of course, we must bear in mind that the distribution of Firefox 100 is carried out gradually, so you may have to wait a few hours to receive it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<h2>New features included in the browser<\/h2>\n<p>We already told you before that here we are going to find some interesting new features that will surely convince you to migrate to the new version.  First of all, let&#8217;s talk about the integration of the support of <strong>subtitles in Picture-in-Picture or PiP video mode<\/strong>.  This is a feature that allows us to play all kinds of videos in a separate window that is always on the screen in the foreground.  All this can be very useful to us and even more so now that it supports the subtitles of websites such as <strong>Youtube<\/strong>Amazon Prime Video or <strong>Netflix<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, and with regard to the usability of Firefox, we also find various <strong>spell checking improvements<\/strong> and of languages.  It is worth mentioning that the spell checking component is now multilingual.  For this we will have to install additional dictionaries.  Changing the third and in regard to the program interface, now we can also select the <strong>preferred color scheme for websites<\/strong> what do we visit.  All this is something that we can configure in the languages \u200b\u200band appearance section of the configuration window.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-735663\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1651743533_281_Firefox-100-arrives-discover-all-its-improvements-and-new-features.jpg\" alt=\"language appearance firefox 100\" width=\"945\" height=\"710\"\/><\/p>\n<h2>Other minor changes introduced by Mozilla<\/h2>\n<p>In the same way, we are also going to find other changes that could be considered minor but that help improve the browser from Firefox 100.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firefox on Mac devices supports the <strong>hdr video<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Windows users with latest generation Intel processors can benefit from the <strong>AV1 video decoding<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>On Windows-based computers with Intel processors, the video overlay is turned on for <strong>reduce battery consumption<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Program scrollbars no longer take up space by default.<\/li>\n<li>Firefox supports credit card autofill in some countries.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As happened a few weeks ago with the Google browser, now comes the first three-digit version of Firefox.
