Save on your electricity bill"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>From <strong>Gain Energy<\/strong>, the low cost electricity company, we want to help you save on your electricity bill with your router.  For this reason, in this article we give you the best tricks to save on your bill with your router.<\/p>\n<h2>How much does a router consume?<\/h2>\n<p>The router, like other small devices such as the electric toothbrush, the sector, etc.. has a <strong>power consumption not too high<\/strong>but if you add up that of all these small devices we are already starting to talk about relevant figures.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>To calculate the consumption of the router, it is important to know the electrical power of the device.  This data usually varies <strong>between 5W to 25W<\/strong> and you can always consult it in the technical data sheet or by searching for the model online.  Once you know the watts (W), you will need to convert them to kilowatts (kW).<\/p>\n<p>Assuming that your router is connected 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to know the consumption of your router you will only have to follow the following formula:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Router daily consumption = <\/strong>(router consumption in kW X 24 hours) X electricity price.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Annual consumption of the router = <\/strong>[(consumo del router en kW X 24 horas) X 365 d\u00edas del a\u00f1o]  X electricity price.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Is it better to leave the router on all day or turn it off?<\/h2>\n<p>If we talk in terms of consumption, it seems more interesting to turn off the router when it is not going to be used.  For example, example at night or when you are not going to be at home.  But other variables really come into play, such as router maintenance and the cybersecurity of your home network.  Therefore, we can summarize the choice in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advantages of leaving the router on all day<\/strong>: you have an internet connection at all times to carry out tasks and increase the durability of the device.<\/li>\n<li>Disadvantages of leaving the router on all day: you consume more energy (although it depends on your rate, it will be reflected more or less on your bill) and you are exposed to a possible cyberattack for more time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What electricity rate is best for me to pay less?<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to know how much the router costs on your electricity bill, you should check the kWh price of your electricity rate.  At Gana Energ\u00eda, as energy experts, we recommend our rates to easily calculate which one you are going to save the most with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rate 2.0TD Without More Than Earns Energy: with this rate with hourly discrimination you would have to calculate consumption at all times, since the price varies depending on the time slots.<\/li>\n<li>Gana Energ\u00eda Online Rate 2.0TD: with this rate with a fixed price without schedules you can easily calculate electricity consumption.
