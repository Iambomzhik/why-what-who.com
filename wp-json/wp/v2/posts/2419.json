Some may be from advertisements or promotions, but it may also be that you are receiving emails from a sender that you do not want or, as we have said before, some that look a bit \u201cstrange\u201d.  You can delete them one by one as we say, but if you block these emails <strong>you will stop receiving them immediately<\/strong>something that will save you a lot of time throughout the week.<\/p>\n<h2>This is how emails are blocked in Outlook<\/h2>\n<p>Blocking an email is actually a very simple process, and it won&#8217;t take more than a few minutes.  It is true that we have the possibility of establishing a rule in our mail so that each time one arrives from a recipient that we mark, it is directly deleted, but it will always be much better if we block it.  To do so, we have <strong>two different methods<\/strong> that will fulfill the same function: one designed to block just one email, and another to do it with more at the same time.<\/p>\n<h3>Block a sender manually<\/h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with how to do it one by one.  This way of blocking an email is more direct than the one we will see just below, but with the inconvenience that we will have to go mail by mail if we want to block more than one.  To do this, you just have to follow the following steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access your Hotmail or Outlook account in the browser<\/li>\n<li>Once inside, look for an email from the recipient you want to block<\/li>\n<li>Click on it with the right button<\/li>\n<li>In the drop-down that will appear, click on Security Options\n<ul>\n<li>Select the option <strong>block sender<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When doing this, a message will appear telling us that<strong> will delete this message and all those that will arrive from this recipient<\/strong>.  In this way, we will be blocking the entire account.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1679505\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This will be the message that will appear.<\/p>\n<h3>Block multiple senders at once<\/h3>\n<p>The other option that we have to block emails is not too difficult either, although it must be recognized that it is somewhat more \u201chidden\u201d than the previous one.  If you intend to block several emails at once, it is much more worthwhile.  If this is your case, follow these steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access your Hotmail or Outlook email account<\/li>\n<li>Once inside, go to the gear icon in the upper right<\/li>\n<li>A dropdown will appear.  Click below where indicated <strong>See all Outlook settings<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>In the new window that appears, click on Mail<\/li>\n<li>Choose <strong>Unwanted email<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Tap Add, and enter the address or addresses you want to block<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As you can see in the following image, this tool will allow us to block all the emails we want almost at the same time.  It is true that for this we will have to enter them manually, but we always have the option of copying them all into a text document <strong>and go pasting them here<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1679508\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1679508\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653628331_525_How-to-block-an-email-in-Hotmail-and-Outlook.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"429\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1679508\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The window where we must enter the emails to be blocked.<\/p>\n<h2>What if I want to unblock an email?<\/h2>\n<p>As we have told you above, by doing this process what we will achieve is not having to receive an email in our inbox again from certain accounts.  Like everything, it can happen that we make a mistake and block an account that was not, or simply decide to change your mind.  If that&#8217;s the case, you&#8217;ll be glad to know that <strong>It is not an irreversible process<\/strong>so you can unlock blocked accounts whenever you want.<\/p>\n<p>Doing it is also very simple.  All we have to do is follow the steps that we have shown you above to block several contacts at the same time.  Here all the emails that we have blocked will appear in a list, and to unblock them all we have to do is click on <strong>trash can icon<\/strong> that will be next to them.<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1679517\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1679517\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653628331_605_How-to-block-an-email-in-Hotmail-and-Outlook.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"429\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1679517\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The trash can icon next to a locked account.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you keep your mailbox up to date, I am sure that you are deleting emails that you do not want almost daily.
