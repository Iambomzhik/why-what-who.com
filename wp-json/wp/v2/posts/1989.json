This, as you can imagine, allows us to give or remove volume to each of the elements in execution depending on the needs of the moment.<\/p>\n<p>This is something that we achieve by clicking with the right mouse button on the mentioned icon, and selecting the Open Mixer option. <strong>volume<\/strong>.  Here all the running programs that have <strong>multimedia contents<\/strong> with its corresponding scroll bar.  Thus we adjust, either in general volume of the system, or each element independently.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time it may be the case that what we want is to further increase the volume of the content to be played.  This is something that can be very helpful in many programs or platforms with sound.  And the basic fact is that we can, at a certain moment, increase the <strong>native sound<\/strong> of Windows.  This way we will have the opportunity to take advantage of the benefits of the speakers that we have installed in the best way.<\/p>\n<h2>Problems we can find<\/h2>\n<p>Although it may seem simple to increase the volume, we must bear in mind that, when doing so, we can find different problems.  This is because the louder the volume, the more the sound tends to distort.  And this can happen, on the one hand, due to the algorithms used by the programs to increase the sound, or, on the other hand, due to the limitations of our headphones or speakers.<\/p>\n<p>Before resorting to this type of program, it is better to try to increase the volume in other ways.  For example, by using Windows&#8217; own volume control, or by physically turning up the volume of the speakers, in case they have an individual volume control.<\/p>\n<p>If the sound is distorted, or heard badly, there is little more we can do.  It may be that the quality is poor (and a low sound is used to hide it), or that our speakers cannot turn up the volume any more.  In both cases, we have few ways to fix these problems.  In the first case, the only solution would be to look for a new audio with higher quality that allows us to amplify it without losing quality, and in the second case, either connect an external amplifier, or buy other speakers with greater power to be able to reproduce these sounds better.<\/p>\n<h2>Programs to increase the volume<\/h2>\n<p>What we are telling you is something that we can achieve by making use of certain applications specially developed for all of this.  But yes, it is also important to know that in addition to this, some of them not only help us increase the volume, but also allow us to improve the <strong>audio quality<\/strong> the system in general.  Of course, although we are going to show you a series of programs that increase the sound volume in Windows, we must be a little careful.<\/p>\n<p>And it is that, if we abuse this functionality, we can distort the <strong>exit<\/strong> of that audio, damage speakers or headphones, or even harm ourselves.<\/p>\n<h3>FxSound<\/h3>\n<p>To begin with, we will talk about the solution of this type called <strong>FxSound<\/strong>.  Specifically, it is a program with which we can do from this link for free.  It is a proposal that has been with us for a good number of years and that has been gaining in experience.  The program natively presents us with several functions that help us adjust and increase the sound volume of the PC.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>We must also take into account that it puts at our disposal a wide variety of predefined modes.  This allows us to improve the audio of the computer depending on the type of content we are listening to.  It is not the same in this sense when we watch a video as when <strong>let&#8217;s play<\/strong>, for example.  In what really interests us here, the program that we are talking about allows us to increase this level of volume that we are commenting on up to 200% over the original.<\/p>\n<h3>SetVol<\/h3>\n<p>The truth is that the volume control of the <strong>sound in windows<\/strong>, sometimes we could say that it is somewhat limited.  That is why many users increasingly resort to third-party solutions.  Well, here we have one that will allow us to manage this section in a deeper way.  Of course, instead of using the usual graphical interface, in this case we use the system command line.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-426124\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653299513_324_The-best-programs-to-increase-the-volume-in-Windows.jpg\" alt=\"SetVol\" width=\"900\" height=\"836\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>To download this program we can do it from this link.  At the same time here we will see a sample of the parameters that we can use in this case to control the <strong>sound volume<\/strong> of Windows.  So we only have to take a look at what interests us in each case to get the most out of SetVol using commands.<\/p>\n<h3>Letasoft Sound Booster<\/h3>\n<p>This is another of the well-known proposals in this same sense to improve the audio and increase it in Windows.  It hardly consumes system resources and we can download it from this link for free for 14 days.  If we have to highlight something about this program, it is that it allows us to increase the volume of the system up to a maximum of 500%, which is not bad.  However, as we mentioned before, it should not be abused either.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-426127\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653299513_765_The-best-programs-to-increase-the-volume-in-Windows.jpg\" alt=\"Letasoft Sound Booster\" width=\"377\" height=\"517\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition, its use is extremely simple, since, after installing the <strong>application<\/strong> in the system, we will see that a new volume controller appears on the right side of the taskbar.  Thus, from it we can activate or deactivate your <strong>function<\/strong>as well as slide the setting to increase the volume up to 500%.<\/p>\n<h3>VLC<\/h3>\n<p>The popular media player <strong>VLC<\/strong> that many of you have on your computer, allows us to turn up the volume of the content we hear here.  We refer to increasing this section above normal, so we are going to see how to achieve it.  The first thing we do is start the program as such and go to the menu option Tools \/ Preferences.  Next, we check the All option at the bottom of the window.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-426130\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653299513_419_The-best-programs-to-increase-the-volume-in-Windows.jpg\" alt=\"VLC volume\" width=\"900\" height=\"640\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>In the right panel, in the list that appears, we go to Interface \/ main interfaces \/ Qt.  So if we take a look at the bottom of the left panel here, we see an entry called Maximum Volume Displayed, so for example we set it to 300. This is a program that we can download from here.<\/p>\n<h3>EarTrumpet<\/h3>\n<p>In this case we find a <strong>UWP app<\/strong> that you can download from the official store of the operating system.  It integrates perfectly with Windows and allows us to improve and increase the volume on the computer.  This way we can manage these levels both in a general way and individually by running applications.  All this through a simple and at the same time intuitive <strong>user interface<\/strong> with multiple sliders.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-426133\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653299513_47_The-best-programs-to-increase-the-volume-in-Windows.jpg\" alt=\"EarTrumpet\" width=\"522\" height=\"363\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>  <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/The-best-programs-to-increase-the-volume-in-Windows.com\/es-es\/store\/p\/app\/9nblggh516xp&#038;chs=200x200&#038;chld=L|0.png\" alt=\"EarTrumpet\"\/>  <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/The-best-programs-to-increase-the-volume-in-Windows.9afc66c4-1c87-44f8-ba5e-6cde87df617d.jpeg\" alt=\"EarTrumpet\"\/>     <\/p>\n<p>Developer: File-New-Project<\/p>\n<h3>boom 3d<\/h3>\n<p>Here we find another well-known proposal in the sector, a program that you can download from this link or from the Microsoft Store.  As its name suggests, its main purpose is to allow us to amplify the volume of Windows and its <strong>Applications<\/strong> through various internal functions of the software.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-426136\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653299513_435_The-best-programs-to-increase-the-volume-in-Windows.jpg\" alt=\"boom 3d\" width=\"836\" height=\"579\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>To do this, it makes use of certain <strong>algorithms<\/strong> with which we manage to increase the volume of the output audio that we obtain.  In order to give you an idea, we can increase this level up to 150% with little loss of quality.<\/p>\n<p>  <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/The-best-programs-to-increase-the-volume-in-Windows.com\/es-es\/store\/p\/app\/9pp81h1nczs1&#038;chs=200x200&#038;chld=L|0.png\" alt=\"boom 3d\"\/>  <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/The-best-programs-to-increase-the-volume-in-Windows.0343706f-c532-4eb0-8423-3899f6376fc0.jpeg\" alt=\"boom 3d\"\/>     <\/p>\n<p>Developer: Global Delight Technologies Pvt. Ltd.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"audio-amplifier-free\">AUDIO AMPLIFIER Free<\/h3>\n<p>It is an interesting tool aimed at users who need to increase the sound level of any audio file without being affected by a loss of quality.  It is recommended for both songs and video files, allowing you to amplify their volume to provide users with a more satisfying multimedia experience.  It has support for a large number of multimedia formats, such as MP3, WAV, OGG, MID, ASF, AC3, MOV, AVI, WMV, FLV, 3GP, VOB and MP4, among others.  With this program we will achieve a maximum profit of 1000%.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-509061 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653299513_359_The-best-programs-to-increase-the-volume-in-Windows.jpg\" alt=\"AUDIO AMPLIFIER Free\" width=\"800\" height=\"359\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Audio Amplifier Free is capable of achieving decent results.  It is capable of preserving the quality of the original file while we change its volume quickly.  As disadvantages we can mention that it does not allow listening to the audio while it is being edited.  Likewise, it will only be able to process a file individually.  In order to carry out batch conversions, it has a paid Pro version.<\/p>\n<p>We can download this application for free from this link.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"equalizer-apo\">Equalizer APO<\/h3>\n<p>This app can also be used as a sound volume enhancer and works on any number of channels.  It stands out for needing low system resources to work, so it can run in the background without us noticing.  It is compatible with VST plugins which allows us to further improve the sound.  The equalizer supports an unlimited number of filters, has a modular graphical interface and is able to integrate seamlessly with Voicemeeter.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-509070 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653299513_484_The-best-programs-to-increase-the-volume-in-Windows.jpg\" alt=\"Equalizer APO\" width=\"800\" height=\"624\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>We can download it for free from here.<\/p>\n<h3>Audio Retoucher<\/h3>\n<p>We are talking about a music transposition tool that is responsible for changing the pitch and tempo of a sound track in real time.  With this application, the sound of an instrument or voice can be slightly modified to facilitate the work of a vocalist or instrumentalist by applying changes of a semitone or whole tone.  The application very simple, and it has been designed just to increase the volume on your Windows device.  If we are not a tech savvy then this is the perfect app for us.  It has a user interface and settings that can be carried out without difficulty.  The program supports the most popular audio formats such as MP3, M4A, FLAC, WAV, AIFF.  After processing, the files are saved in MP3 or WAV format.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-744477 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653299513_363_The-best-programs-to-increase-the-volume-in-Windows.jpg\" alt=\"Audio Retoucher\" width=\"768\" height=\"551\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Audio Retoucher can be purchased for $39.95, although a free trial version is also available so that we can see first-hand if it meets our needs.<\/p>\n<h3>DeskFX Audio Enhancer<\/h3>\n<p>As we can guess from its name, this application will help us improve our audio experience.  For this, it does not focus exclusively on increasing the volume but also on the quality of the sound.  It is designed so that we can modify and improve the music and audio played through your speakers and headphones, to provide you with the best possible sound experience.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-744480 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653299513_811_The-best-programs-to-increase-the-volume-in-Windows.jpg\" alt=\"DeskFX Audio Enhancer\" width=\"900\" height=\"472\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>To do this, it supports various special effects and has a 20-band equalizer that will allow us to switch between graphic, parametric, visual or any other equalizer on the list.  It also allows us to eliminate noise from audio clips, allows effects to be superimposed and has commercial presets.  All this making use of low CPU consumption and low latency.<\/p>\n<p>This app costs only $19.99, but we can also download a 14-day free trial from its official website.<\/p>\n<h2>Which is the best of all?<\/h2>\n<p>As we can see, there is a good variety of programs that allow us to control the volume of our computer in a much more precise way than what Windows itself offers us.  In addition, each program has its own pros and cons, each of them being perfect for one task or another.<\/p>\n<p>If what we are looking for is a kind of equalizer for Windows, then the first of the programs that we must try is <strong>FxSound.<\/strong> This program will allow us to adjust the sound of the PC according to a series of predefined modes, or adjust each one of the channels according to our tastes.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if what we are looking for is to be able to amplify the volume of our headphones or speakers above 100%, then the program that we must install on the computer is none other than <strong>Letasoft Sound Booster<\/strong>.  Thanks to this software, we are not only going to recover the classic slider to adjust the volume of the PC, but we can even raise this volume above 100%, specifically up to 500%.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, if what we are looking for is to control the sound of each of the programs that we have open on the computer, the software that we must install is <strong>EarTrumpet.<\/strong> This program is anchored in the system tray and, when you click on it, it shows us a list with all the PC applications that are generating sound, being able to raise or lower the sound of each of them individually.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the same way we have the possibility of independently managing each one of the levels of the programs in execution.
