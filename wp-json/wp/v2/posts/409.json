They can be considered as one of the most used applications of all those that we have installed on the computer or mobile.  There are a good number of options to choose from, such as Google Chrome, <strong>firefox<\/strong>Edge, Chrome, <strong>Vivaldi<\/strong>Opera and many more.<\/p>\n<p>In these lines we want to talk about an open source project that many consider to be a very interesting private alternative to the popular Chrome, we are referring to Chromium.  This is one of the many browsers that we can use right now to access our <strong>online platforms and favorite websites<\/strong>.  One of the many advantages that this application offers us with respect to <strong>Google<\/strong>is that it does not implement the functions of <strong>search giant tracking<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, it is a <strong>open source project<\/strong> on which many other such developments are based.  We can download it for free from its official website and benefit from all the functions it offers us.  Thanks to the work of the main developers of this application, the arrival of new and more advanced features is quite common.  This is a common point in most of the programs belonging to this sector.  The main reason for all this is the enormous market penetration they have.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if we focus on the use of <strong>chrome<\/strong>, we will tell you that its developers and designers try to make it easy for us to access test functions.  With this, what we want to tell you is that we will have many facilities when trying first-hand what they are working on at that moment.<\/p>\n<h2>Try new Chromium features before anyone else<\/h2>\n<p>The first thing to know here is that most of the creators of these programs do tests with the <strong>new features and functionalities<\/strong> before making them available to everyone.  In this way, the users who wish to do so can assess first-hand whether <strong>worth implementing in the final version<\/strong> of the program that function, or not.  Once its effectiveness and acceptance by browser clients had been verified, it is more than likely that it will be implemented in the final version.<\/p>\n<p>But in the same way, these test characteristics are often definitively discarded.  This means that, after his <strong>evaluation by users<\/strong>, the decision was made to discard it due to little success or malfunction.  Therefore, as we mentioned before in Chromium we have the possibility of <strong>try these novelties before anyone else <\/strong>In a simple way.  For all this we start a normal window in the web browser and take a look at the upper part of its interface.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>Located on the right side of the <strong>address bar<\/strong>, we find a button that has the shape of a flask.  It must be said that it gives us direct access to the experiments that Chromium developers make available to us at that moment.  In the drop-down list that appears next to each of these new functions we can activate it or put some of its own characteristics into operation.<\/p>\n<p>It must be taken into account that here we can find certain operating errors.  So much so that even from this section we can <strong>send comments informing<\/strong> from them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The companies that develop current internet browsers are fully aware of the importance of their programs.
