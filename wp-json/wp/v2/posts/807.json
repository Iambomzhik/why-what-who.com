You will see the new data reflected in the My Vodafone App as of 07\/01 here: m.vodafone.es\/new-yuser.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This gift of an extra 5 GB at a Yu fee is not something new.  Last year they added <strong>5 GB extra without price increase<\/strong> to those customers who had the Heavy Yuser rate.  Now the reason seems somewhat different, since new rates could be added and others adapted in a new portfolio that should be announced shortly.<\/p>\n<h2>New Classic Big Yuser fare<\/h2>\n<p>As we said, this increase in gigabytes corresponds to a variation in the denominations of tariffs that will take place on July 1, which suggests that in addition to the change from Big Yuser to classic Big Yuser, a new batch of tariffs could reach Vodafone Yu .<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-250326\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-250326\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652884394_249_Vodafone-Yu-increases-5-GB-for-free-in-one-of.jpg\" alt=\"vodafone\" width=\"715\" height=\"378\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-250326\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vodafone Yu<\/p>\n<p>If we add the 5 GB of extra data each month to the current Big Yuser conditions, we would have a Classic Big Yuser result like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited gigabytes in RRSS and messaging.
