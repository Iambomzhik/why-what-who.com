ETIENNE LAURENT EFE<\/p>\n<p class=\"ue-c-article__standfirst\">Next Sunday, February 13, the <strong>Sofi Stadium in Inglewood <\/strong>(California) host the<strong> Super Bowl Finals<\/strong> Come in<strong> Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals.<\/strong> The most important sporting event in the United States is on its way to breaking all records in ticket prices.<\/p>\n<p>It won&#8217;t just be the millions of dollars advertisers pay for the<strong> advertising <\/strong>which is broadcast during the match.  Spectators who want to go to the stadium will have to shell out figures never seen before to experience it live. <\/p>\n<p>The desire to attend live events, after the last wave of infections from the covid-19 pandemic, and the fact that the final of the <strong>National Football League (NFL)<\/strong> disputed in the second largest metropolitan area in the country has resulted in a<strong> explosive combination. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>home team, <strong>Los Angeles Rams<\/strong>, is facing the opportunity to get the second title in its history in its own territory.  The first was conquered in 2000 when they were still playing as a team from Saint Louis (Missouri).  To this is added, a city full of millionaires and &#8216;celebrities&#8217; who will not want to miss the first final to be played there in 30 years.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is Los Angeles. The entertainment capital of the world, where the prices of everything are through the roof. We are facing a perfect storm,&#8221; he explains. <strong>Adam Budelli<\/strong>spokesperson for the ticket sales platform StubHub to the CNN network. <\/p>\n<p>If in past editions at least <strong>$1,000<\/strong> (875 euros) <strong>for a seat <\/strong>in the last ring of the stadium, <strong>this year the cheapest is already over 5,500 dollars<\/strong>, according to the tickets that were still available this Monday on StubHub.  A price that is expected to increase as the match date approaches. <\/p>\n<p>In the first rows of the wings, the most expensive areas of the stadium and closest to the team benches, the<strong> most expensive chair is $48,000 <\/strong>not including sales commissions.  The Bengals are also facing a historic moment with the possibility of winning their first Vince Lombardi Trophy, after losing two Finals in 1982 and 1989. <\/p>\n<p>Not forgetting the <strong>rest show<\/strong> that attracts more viewers than the game itself.  This year, the performance will be performed by the legendary hip hop singer and producer <strong>dr dre<\/strong>and the rappers <strong>Snoop Doog, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar<\/strong>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals will play the Super Bowl final next Sunday.
