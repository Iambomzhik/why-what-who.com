First, to set up your offer, <strong>it is necessary to select your connectivity<\/strong>, the fiber Internet package that you are going to want.  Here the cheapest option to later have all the football at the best price would be the combination of Fiber 300 Mbps together with a mobile line of 30 GB of data.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1637040\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Configure MiMovistar<\/p>\n<p>This minimum speed is priced at 54.90 euros per month (promoted at half price, 27.45 euros per month, for the first three months).  Along with this first choice you will have to<strong> You must subscribe to Movistar Plus+ Esencia<\/strong>l to start setting up the TV to your liking.  This initial television package includes Series by M+ and Premieres by M+ and costs 10 euros per month (5 euros per month for the first three bills).<\/p>\n<p>This would mean that, from the start, you would have to pay <strong>64.90 euros per month without promotion before being able to choose the football packages<\/strong>.

This makes a total of<strong> 107.90 euros per month<\/strong> always at least.  In the event that you contract it within the promotional period (until May 31, 2022), the price would be reduced in the first three monthly payments to 53.95 euros.<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1639215\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1639215\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652123884_135_How-much-does-it-cost-to-watch-all-the-football.jpg\" alt=\"miMovistar packages\" width=\"715\" height=\"349\"\/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1639215\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">miMovistar packages to watch all the football<\/p>\n<p>If you can afford to give up European competition matches because you don&#8217;t have free time during the week or your team doesn&#8217;t play them, the LaLiga package is 30 euros per month (15 in promotion) instead of the 43 euros of the complete football pack.<\/p>\n<p>To this should be added a possible extra.  Although Movistar will broadcast the 5 LaLiga matches that DAZN has after reaching an agreement with the sports streaming platform, DAZN continues to maintain the rights to the Copa del Rey (except for some matches that are also broadcast free-to-air by Mediaset) and the Premier League in full exclusively.  If you would like this addition, <strong>you can also hire DAZN directly from Movistar<\/strong> as part of the Sports package, which includes the NBA, Liga Endesa, rugby, golf, tennis and DAZN.  In this case, it would be an additional cost of 18 euros per month or 9 euros in promotion for three months.<\/p>\n<p>To recap: watching all the football on Movistar Plus+ configuring it from miMovistar can have a minimum cost of 107.90 euros per month for the package with the League and Champions and <strong>125.90 euros per month<\/strong> if you are more of a football fan than Maldini and MisterChip combined and you also want to watch DAZN matches that are not from LaLiga.<\/p>\n<p>If you want more information, you can call 900 411 707 for free or use the miMovistar configurator to create your own accounts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week the official presentation of the new rates miMovistar, a new way to configure your services with Movistar completely \u00e0 la carte, choosing which ones you want and which ones you don&#8217;t.
