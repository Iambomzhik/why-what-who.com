In the same way, it allows us to take advantage of the mouse wheel to move between the applications anchored here and thus use Windows 10 in a more fluid way.  In addition, we can create <strong>custom actions<\/strong>for example, when clicking with the mouse in an empty area, either with the left button, or with the middle button.<\/p>\n<p>7+ Taskbar Tweaker is a free application that we can download from the developer&#8217;s website.<\/p>\n<h3>TaskbarCustomizer, change the appearance of the bar instantly<\/h3>\n<p>We are talking about an application that allows us to manipulate certain aspects of the taskbar in Windows 10. With it, we can change whether or not the Start button is visible and we can also change whether the Show desktop button is visible to take advantage of the maximum screen.  It&#8217;s also possible to change the position of all pinned items on the taskbar, highlight items with color, or even make it transparent to show just the icons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-724665 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653304475_410_Customize-the-Windows-taskbar.jpg\" alt=\"TaskbarCustomizer\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>This lightweight and open source tool is easy to use, so we can change the appearance of the bar instantly.  Although it must be said that we can find some errors of its own development.  We can also modify its opacity to match our wallpaper, as well as reduce its width.  With all this, the application gives us the <strong>freedom to customize<\/strong> the appearance of our taskbar to better suit our tastes and preferences, although some more advanced options are missing.<\/p>\n<p>If we want to use TaskbarCustomizer we can download its latest version available from its GitHub repository.<\/p>\n<h3>TaskbarDock, very simple and effective<\/h3>\n<p>It is a simple utility that has been developed to customize the Windows 10 taskbar.

Its use is simple because it will only add an icon to the system tray from which you can make all the configuration settings.<\/p>\n<p>TaskbarDock is a free and open source application that we can download from GitHub.<\/p>\n<h3>TranslucentTB, make the bar translucent and transparent<\/h3>\n<p>It is a small, light and easy-to-use program with which you can customize the Windows 10 taskbar to give it a more elegant touch, making it translucent and transparent. <strong>Consumes very few system resources<\/strong> so it can be used by old or less powerful computers without problems.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-724686 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653304475_399_Customize-the-Windows-taskbar.jpg\" alt=\"TranslucentTB for Windows 10\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>With it we will be able to customize its effect and color, as well as combine states (maximized window, open start menu, open Cortana and open timeline).

It is currently in its early stages although it does support taskbar styling features, <strong>supports multiple monitors and supports DPI scaling<\/strong> separately, more features are expected to be included in their own releases.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-724704 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653304475_797_Customize-the-Windows-taskbar.jpg\" alt=\"taskbarXI\" width=\"800\" height=\"499\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>The application has a simple interface that allows us <strong>change bar settings<\/strong>, admitting that it can be located both centrally and to the left of the screen.

We can choose from a wide variety of themes to choose from, as well as the possibility of creating our own themes in XAML format.  It also allows fonts to be smoothed to make them look better, hide the clock, remove icons from the notification area so they don&#8217;t bother, among other functions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-724698 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653304475_442_Customize-the-Windows-taskbar.jpg\" alt=\"backbar\" width=\"920\" height=\"70\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Another of its most striking features is the possibility of showing the taskbar on any side of the screen, as well as showing the bar, the notification area and the clock on several monitors.  In addition, it has a Windows XP-style collapsible notification area that we can also customize.  The application is completely portable, so it will not be necessary to carry out any type of installation on our computer.<\/p>\n<p>We can download Retrobar for free from its GitHub page.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Ashampoo Taskbar Customizer, make taskbar disappear<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This application focuses on modifying the purely aesthetic section of the taskbar without touching its internal operation.  Just run it <strong>set the bar to translucent<\/strong>, so it has almost disappeared, something that many users claim as something that the operating system should include by default.  It also has a color selector to change its appearance in real time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-724692 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653304475_995_Customize-the-Windows-taskbar.jpg\" alt=\"Ashampoo Taskbar Customizer customize\" width=\"700\" height=\"413\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Unlike the rest of the applications that we have seen, Ashampoo Taskbar Customizer requires that we buy its license to be able to use it, which has a cost of 14.99 euros.
