Mainly, the news related to the platform has focused on reporting the celebrities who have opened an account, as well as detailing how much some celebrities earn on OnlyFans.<\/p>\n<p>The media make it clear that it is a social network in which nudes and erotic and sexual content can be published, but on many occasions the information does not go further. <\/p>\n<p>For this reason, you may be wondering <strong>what is OnlyFans, how does it work, what is its business model and why has it become so popular in recent months.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>During isolation, many of us are turning to video games to pass the time.  But playing in company is always more fun than doing it alone, so we leave you with a list of apps that you can play with your partner<\/p>\n<p>If you have heard about this social network for adults but you are not very clear about the concept, keep reading because in this report we are going to explain it to you<strong> everything you need to know about OnlyFans.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><u><strong>Everything you need to know about OnlyFans<\/strong><\/u><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">What is OnlyFans?<\/h2>\n<p>What is Only Fans is the first question asked by people who hear about the platform in the media.  Is about <strong>an adults-only social network where content creators share erotic or sexual images and videos<\/strong> of all types and categories. <\/p>\n<p>And it is that, unlike conventional social networks, this platform not only does not censor these contents, but they are its main claim. <\/p>\n<p>However, <strong>not everything that is published on OnlyFans is erotic<\/strong>.  There are also accounts of famous chefs, artists or fitness stars who have a profile and share photos and videos with their followers.<\/p>\n<p>Although there are free channels, in most cases, in order to access the content, users have to become fans of the person who publishes it.  For it, <strong>they have to subscribe to the profile and pay a monthly fee, <\/strong>whose amount is set by the creator within minimum and maximum margins established by the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Have you heard of Omegle but are not sure what it is?  We tell you what one of the most dangerous social networks that you should avoid consists of and how it works.<\/p>\n<p>Even though Only Fans&#8217; popularity has skyrocketed recently, <strong>it is not a newly created service.  The platform was born in 2016<\/strong> and initially it was not a social network for adults, but a meeting point between artists and their followers. <\/p>\n<p>The idea was to offer a place where<strong> artists will provide their fans with exclusive content<\/strong>which they could access in exchange for a monthly subscription.<\/p>\n<p>But the initial approach took a turn in 2018. Leonid Radvinsky, owner of the live sex website MyFreeCams, bought 75% of Only Fans and became the director of the platform, giving it the identity it has today. today.<\/p>\n<p>In May 2020, Tim Stokely, founder and CEO of OnlyFans, claimed that the adult social network had more than 30 million registered users. <strong>Subscriptions grew incredibly during the pandemic: in April alone they increased by more than 50%<\/strong>and the number of creators also skyrocketed, reaching 450,000 at the time.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">How does OnlyFans work?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>In Onlyfans there are two types of users: fans and content creators<\/strong>and in both cases it is necessary to be over 18 years of age to access the social network. <\/p>\n<p>Fans can create their account for free to explore the people who are publishing content on the platform, but as we said to have access to the photos and videos that are shared, it is necessary to subscribe and pay the monthly fee set by the creator.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Apart from seeing the content that the creators publish, fans can receive paid messages with photos or premium videos<\/strong>and to be able to view them they have to make an additional payment. <\/p>\n<p>In addition, they can also write private messages to request personalized requests, such as photos or videos with certain characteristics, and the creator can provide them with this content in exchange for an extra payment called a tip.<\/p>\n<p>Men\u00e9ame is a community focused on current news, stories and curiosities that the users themselves publish, for others to vote for and upload to the front page.  Let&#8217;s see how it came about, and what are the reasons for its success.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In Onlyfans anyone can become a content creator<\/strong>.  All you have to do is create a free account and verify registration with a selfie that allows the platform to confirm the user&#8217;s identity. <\/p>\n<p>Once this is done, the next step in OnlyFans is to set the monthly subscription fee for fans, and start uploading content to attract followers. <\/p>\n<p><strong>And how much money is earned on Onlyfans? <\/strong>Content creators receive income through three ways: the subscription fee, paid messages and tips.  The amount of the subscription can range between 4.99 and 49.99 dollars, and according to the platform you can earn up to 7,495 dollars per month. <\/p>\n<p>Beyond subscriptions, creators can also earn money from paid messages and tips.  Fans have to pay up to $100 for paid messages, while the cap on tips can be as high as $200. <\/p>\n<p>The daily spending of fans cannot exceed 500 dollars in the case of new users, but if they have been using the social network in a stable way for some time, this limit is increased (although it is not specified what the maximum would be in this case).<\/p>\n<p>And how is the Onlyfans payment system? <strong>Creators receive 80% of their earnings revenue, including subscribers, paid messages and tips<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The remaining 20% \u200b\u200bcovers referral payments, payment processing, hosting, support, and all other services. <\/p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">The OnlyFans Boom<\/h2>\n<p>As we said at the beginning, OnlyFans is not a new platform, but until recently it was not that popular. <strong>The boom of the social network for adults occurs as a result of the confinement<\/strong>.  Last April, Beyonc\u00e9 released a charity remix of Savage with rapper Megan Thee Stallion, the proceeds of which went to charity for the pandemic. <\/p>\n<p>In the lyrics of the song we find a reference to OnlyFans, and as Stokely explains in BuzzFeed News, <strong>on those dates the platform registered some 200,000 new users a day and between 7,000 and 8,000 new content creators.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And why has the quarantine fueled the meteoric growth of OnlyFans?  On the one hand, home confinement and social distancing measures <strong>have favored the consumption of adult content by users. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is the reference forum on the Internet.  This is where things happen before anywhere.  We teach you how to use it so as not to get lost in its immensity.<\/p>\n<p>From the point of view of content creators, professionals in the porn industry, models, influencers and other famous people <strong>they have seen in OnlyFans a way out of the labor and economic problems derived from the restrictions of the pandemic<\/strong>. <\/p>\n<p>Given the lack of projects and job opportunities, they have discovered that this social network can be a real gold mine in which it is possible to earn thousands of dollars a month by publishing erotic or sexual content. <\/p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">How much money do celebrities make on OnlyFans?<\/h2>\n<p>In OnlyFans anyone can earn money, but <strong>Thanks to their popularity, celebrities have more options to achieve stratospheric figures. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>One of the most notorious cases is that of Bella Thorne<\/strong>, the popular former Disney girl.  The actress joined the platform in August 2020, managed to earn more than a million dollars in the first 24 hours and added more than two million dollars in less than a week. <\/p>\n<p>The problem is that <strong>the fans were very unhappy<\/strong>.  She promised nudes for a $200 payment, but fans received photos of Thorne in her underwear. <\/p>\n<p>This caused a wave of chargebacks from fans, which led the platform to change its policy of paying creators, who today have restrictions that limit the amount they can collect and the speed with which they can be paid. They can reap the benefits of your content.<\/p>\n<p>We give you some tips to download any video from Facebook from all your devices and without the need for other applications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There are many other content creators who make a lot of money on Only Fans<\/strong>.  Ellie-Jean Coffey, a former professional surfer, managed to amass 3 million dollars in three months.  Aella, an adult film actress, has more than 26,000 fans and earns around $100,000 a month. <\/p>\n<p>Erica North is another recognized star of the social network with more than 150,000 fans.  From February 2019 to November 2020, she generated more than $215,000 with her account, about $14,000 a month.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In Spain, various well-known faces have confessed to earning large amounts of money on OnlyFans.<\/strong> Daniela Blume is one of the celebrities who obtain the most benefits on the national scene, and affirms that she came to earn 20,000 euros in a single day. <\/p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">The controversy with pornographic content<\/h2>\n<p>But in August 2021 there was an important debate on OnlyFans that is going to have a series of consequences that are difficult to foresee: OnlyFans stopped admitting pornographic content on the platform for a few days.<\/p>\n<p>The reason for this change arose from<strong> the need to seek greater financing and the problems that investors have caused them<\/strong> and banks due to its theme, such as PayPal.  Putting money on an erotic website is admissible, but on one with pornographic content it is a significant risk and they do not want to associate their name with these practices.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, with the aim of avoiding controversy, OnlyFans was asked that all people who offered sex be <strong>identified and prove that they are of legal age<\/strong>something that is almost impossible for the platform.<\/p>\n<p>However, days later they returned to the previous situation and stated that OnlyFans allowed sexually explicit content on their platform again.  It seems that the reaction to the veto of this content showed them the problem that they could experience in terms of the exit of users and influencers.<\/p>\n<p>It is not known what will happen from now on or how they will carry out the negotiation to survive as a company, what is clear is that any modification in the terms of this content <strong>can forever change what the platform is like<\/strong>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the last year OnlyFans has caught the attention of the media.
