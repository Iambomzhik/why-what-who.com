This completely determines how we are to drive the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>By being able to plug into a power outlet, this type of technology provides huge advantages over the normal hybrid car.  On the one hand, you can have larger batteries for the electric motor, which <strong>increases its electric range<\/strong>.  On the other hand, by running the electric motor for a longer time, the consumption of fossil fuels will be lower, therefore, and consumption and emissions will be greatly reduced.<\/p>\n<p>In those, the possibility of circulating in 100% electric mode for a long time makes plug-in cars ideal for moving around urban environments, no matter how restrictive anti-pollution policies may be.  Now, do you have any curiosity that can make you special?  The truth is that if.  And much is focused on their <strong>care and maintenance<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>Points to consider<\/h2>\n<p>In this sense, if we have a vehicle with these characteristics, driving efficiently is essential to save money and energy, in addition to contributing to reducing environmental pollution and reducing risks on the road.  But we must also pay attention to what they need, especially if what we are looking for is to travel long distances.<\/p>\n<p>As such, what you should know is that yes;  given that it is a propulsion system that adds complexity to those used by conventional gasoline and diesel, its maintenance is somewhat higher and <strong>slightly more expensive<\/strong>but neither is it a capital element that is going to suppose an exaggerated cost overrun.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, the battery, like any element of the car, also breaks down and goes <strong>losing efficiency<\/strong> with use and the passage of time.  That is why it is important that, together with the rest of the vehicle, we pay attention to what the car may ask of us.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<h3>Pay attention to tires and shock absorbers<\/h3>\n<p>Within the electrical system, there is an added weight that makes the vehicle feel more.  This is the case of tires, which <strong>suffer much more<\/strong> wear because they withstand a greater load.  While the shock absorbers work also more.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the latter, they have to accommodate a <strong>higher weighing<\/strong> and therefore they work more.  Following this logic, one might think that it happens with the brakes as well, but the truth is that even with the added weight, the existence of regenerative braking systems that help to hold the vehicle also collaborate to extend the life of the discs and pads.<\/p>\n<h3>Start it in combustion mode<\/h3>\n<p>Another good recommendation to take care of our plug-in hybrid car is to start it in combustion mode.  All PHEVs start in electric mode, but there is an option when the car is still plugged in that allows it to start with the combustion engine to preheat it.<\/p>\n<p>This is for no other purpose than to get it to the point where the batteries perform most efficiently and <strong>protecting them from overexertion. <\/strong>Also, once the heat engine is forced to start for the first time, it performs an effective warm-up cycle.  In this way, the engine is prepared for whatever comes its way.<\/p>\n<h3>Opt for a smooth and calm drive<\/h3>\n<p>Smooth driving is always key to reducing consumption.  In a <strong>plug-in hybrid car<\/strong>In addition, it is really necessary when starting, since, as we mentioned, the electric motor delivers all its strength from the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, driving calmly helps us increase the energy obtained by the <strong>regenerative brake<\/strong> (When you lift your foot off the brake, without the mechanical brakes actually acting, the kinetic energy of braking is converted into electrical energy and is stored for use).  Thus, the autonomy of the battery can be increased on the same journey.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Plug-in hybrid setup just got smarter We start from the basis that the &#8216;brain&#8217; of the plug-in hybrid car chooses at all times what configuration is more efficient in terms of energy consumption (and emissions): combustion engine, electric motor or a combination of both.
