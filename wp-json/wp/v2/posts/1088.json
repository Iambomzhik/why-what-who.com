We must take into account the enormous number of attacks of all kinds through malware to which we are exposed.  Now we are going to talk about two products offered by the renowned <strong>Kaspersky security firm<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the fact that Microsoft in its Windows operating system offers us its own antivirus, Windows Defender, many users prefer to install external alternatives.  For this, a company with a more than proven reputation is usually chosen, as is the case at hand in these lines.  We tell you all this because next we are going to tell other differences between two of the <strong>Kaspersky solutions<\/strong>one of the best known security firms.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is that this company has been offering its products to users around the world for many years.  This means that it has earned the trust of the majority who continue to use its security solutions to protect computers.  We must bear in mind that here we find a series of paid titles in the form of security suites, but they also offer us a free antivirus.  It is for all these reasons that we will now talk about the differences between <strong>Kaspersky Free and Security Cloud<\/strong> so that you can choose the option that most interests you.<\/p>\n<p>And it is that when choosing a specific antivirus various parameters come into play.  To start with the price, the reliability of the company that offers us the product, and the functions included in each solution.  We must bear in mind that the security of our computer will depend on this choice, which we also generally keep installed for at least one year.<\/p>\n<h2>Differences between Kaspersky Free and Security Cloud antivirus<\/h2>\n<p>Both solutions that we mention here perfectly meet their objective, which is none other than <strong>protect ourselves against all kinds of attacks and malicious codes<\/strong>.  However, the additional functions offered by one and the other are quite different, as well as their cost.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The price of antivirus<\/strong>: As its name suggests, Kaspersky Free is a free antivirus that we can download from the firm&#8217;s official website at no cost.  In addition, we will receive updates as Kaspersky releases them to keep the protection of the software intact.  However, Security Cloud comes at a cost <strong>from 70 euros per year<\/strong> Licensed for three teams.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Integrated additional functions<\/strong>: As it is evident, the paid version offers a series of functions integrated by default that we do not find in the free one.  It is worth mentioning that Kaspersky Free sticks to its main purpose, to protect against malware, without further ado.  However, the paid versions of Kaspersky Free go one step further.  Here we can highlight the availability of a <strong>vpn<\/strong>an <strong>password manager<\/strong>account verification, <strong>Wi-Fi network analysis<\/strong>in addition to power <strong>optimize the operating system<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Other types of protection<\/strong>: while the free version is limited to protecting our computer and system, Security Cloud takes care of other sections.  With this we want to tell you that we can protect our <strong>Privacy<\/strong>the <strong>online payments<\/strong>or even the smallest thanks to the <strong>Parental control<\/strong> included.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Therefore, and after all that has been said, when choosing one proposal or another, we must take into account the needs we seek to cover.  If basic protection against all types of malicious code is enough for us, the <strong>free version is perfect<\/strong>.  On the contrary, if we require greater protection, something very useful both at the user and company level, we will have to pay to have the additional functions that we have mentioned.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Having an antivirus installed on our computer nowadays is something almost basic.
