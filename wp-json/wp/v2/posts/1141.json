What we forget is that in order to enjoy our telephone line or our data bonus there is an even more important element: the SIM card.  Without this small card we will not be able to use our phone number, so if it is lost or broken it can be a hassle. <strong>The operators give us the opportunity to request a duplicate<\/strong>and we tell you everything that implies.<\/p>\n<p>The SIM card is nothing more than a small plastic card with a chip on it.  This chip stores the client&#8217;s telephone number and the necessary passwords to be able to use the operator&#8217;s network.  As with all devices that store information, it is possible <strong>transfer this to a new SIM card<\/strong>and that&#8217;s basically what SIM card duplication is all about.<\/p>\n<h2>When can we request a duplicate?<\/h2>\n<p>As we have told you a little above, requesting a duplicate SIM card is a process offered by all operators.  Each operator has a process for this that is really very similar in all cases, although we can find some important differences, especially in price (as we will see later).  The most important thing we have to keep in mind is that to request a duplicate <strong>it is essential to be the owner of the line<\/strong>.  Of course, Movistar allows the duplicate to be done by another person, as long as they have a signed authorization.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing that we also have to take into account is that it is a process that <strong>we must do in person<\/strong> in one of our operator&#8217;s stores.  Operators have been offering their customers the possibility of carrying out a multitude of procedures through mobile apps and in the customer tabs of their web pages for several years now, but card duplication is not one of them. <strong>There are two operators that offer an exception at this point<\/strong>: Vodafone (only exceptionally, through 1550) and Orange, which sends it home.<\/p>\n<p>Going into the reasons that the operators establish to make a duplicate, we must point out that these are part of a closed list.  Usually, <strong>There are 5 reasons we may have to request one of these duplicates<\/strong>and are next:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our SIM card is damaged or not working properly<\/li>\n<li>loss or theft<\/li>\n<li>technology change<\/li>\n<li>Change of SIM card to another type of card (you may need a different size for your device)\n<ul>\n<li>Operators now offer triple SIM or triple cut format, which allows us to &#8220;cut&#8221; the card to the size we need<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>PUK number blocking<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1666038\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SIM Triple Movistar cut.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, it is worth adding two more details about the duplicate.  The first of them is that when we make a duplicate SIM card, the previous one stops working, since it is not possible to have the number active on two different cards (unless we have a MultiSIM service).  The second is related to the data that goes inside the card, and that is that despite the fact that the new card will work in the same way as the previous one, we must take into account that <strong>the phone numbers stored in it are not kept<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>This will cost you to duplicate your SIM card<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to talk about the cost of duplicating a SIM card.  In most cases, this process <strong>It will be associated with a different cost for all operators<\/strong>, although we can find some exceptions among the big operators.  Vodafone, for example, indicates on its customer service page that this process will not incur any cost if new customers do not receive the SIM, or receive a defective one.  It also makes another additional exception for prepaid customers: there will be no cost in case of theft (if it is proven by complaint).<\/p>\n<p>To finish this article, we are going to show you the current prices of duplicating the SIM card with the four major operators in our country, that is, Movistar, Vodafone, Orange and Yoigo.<\/p>\n<table id=\"tablepress-480\" class=\"tablepress table-block block-collapse-amp tablepress-id-480\">\n<tr class=\"row-1 odd\">\n<th class=\"column-1\">operator<\/th>\n<th class=\"column-2\">Duplicate Cost<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tbody class=\"row-hover\">\n<tr class=\"row-2 even\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">Movistar<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">14.5 euros (VAT included)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3 odd\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">Vodafone<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">Peninsula and Balearic Islands: 5 euros (VAT included)<br \/>Canary Islands: 4.45 euros (IGIC included)<br \/>Ceuta and Melilla: 4.24 euros (not subject to IPSI)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-4 even\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">Orange<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">In store: 5 euros (VAT included)<br \/>At home: 12 euros<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-5 odd\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">Yoigo<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">7.26 euros (VAT included)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are all more than used to using our mobile devices without further ado, worrying only about taking care of them so that they last us as long as possible.
