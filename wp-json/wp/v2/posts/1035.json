Depending on our needs, the type of capture device used, or the software we have installed, we opt for one image format or another.  In these lines we want to focus on a program of the importance of <strong>ACDSee Photo Studio and RAW files<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Most users prefer to use image formats with certain levels of compression in order to handle large amounts of them while consuming little space.  Of course, as we need photographs of higher quality and resolution without using high levels of compression, we will have to opt for other formats.  Among these we find the aforementioned <strong>raw<\/strong> that on many occasions is used in more professional environments.<\/p>\n<p>For all this that we are telling you, we will have to use both <strong>capture devices<\/strong> as software compatible with all of this.  The truth is that most current mid-range or high-end cameras can capture images in RAW format.  The same thing happens if we focus on the software in which we will upload these files in the form of photo editors.  As it could not be otherwise, the previously mentioned software ACDSee Photo Studio offers us an enormous <strong>compatibility with all types of formats<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, those responsible for the application update it so that we can work with the most recent ones that appear on the market.  But now we are going to talk about the <strong>RAW compatibility<\/strong>since we will not always find the facilities of other types of files.<\/p>\n<h2>See if your camera&#8217;s RAW is supported in ACDSee Photo Studio<\/h2>\n<p>To give you an idea of \u200b\u200bthe importance of all this, the developers of this application in particular offer us useful information.  In this way we will be able to verify first-hand whether our <strong>digital camera<\/strong> generates the RAW files that will later be compatible with the program itself.  And it is that not all capture devices are compatible with all photo editing programs, including ACDSee Photo Studio.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously to know the compatibility of the photo editor with our device, the first thing we need is <strong>know exactly the model our camera<\/strong>.  Once we know it, the developers of the application offer us an extensive list of devices compatible with the RAW files that we can use in the software.  In order to take a look at all this that we tell you, you will only have to access the website especially dedicated to it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>Here we find the vast majority of <strong>digital camera manufacturers<\/strong> that have RAW compatible devices.  Thus, we will only have to open the <strong>drop-down list corresponding to the manufacturer of our camera<\/strong> to take a look if the model appears in the listing.  Generally we shouldn&#8217;t encounter too many compatibility issues with these files.  But before acquiring a license for this application, especially if we plan to work with RAW, it would not hurt to carry out this check.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to working with our photos on the PC, there are many file formats of this type that we have at our fingertips.
