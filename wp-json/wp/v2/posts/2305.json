To do this, follow these steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Access the My Vodafone App from your mobile or your private My Vodafone area.<\/li>\n<li>In the menu of your mobile, go to \u201cMy products\u201d &gt; \u201cProducts and services\u201d and select the \u201cTelevision\u201d service or, in your computer, to \u201cWhat you have contracted\u201d &gt; \u201cTelevision\u201d &gt; \u201cMulti-device TV\u201d.<\/li>\n<li>Click on \u201cManage your device\u201d on your mobile or on \u201cActivate now\u201d on your computer.<\/li>\n<li>Enter an e-mail (it asks you twice) and click on \u201cActivate\u201d.<\/li>\n<li>You receive an e-mail in your inbox that confirms the activation and asks you to set a password (if you don&#8217;t receive it within 1 hour, check your spam box).<\/li>\n<li>Once your account is created, you have to download the app on your devices if you haven&#8217;t already done so.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>How to watch on Chromecast<\/h2>\n<p>Once we have everything in order, the following will be the process to send the contents to the screen where the Chromecast is connected.
