Whether to make a reservation for a trip, to buy something in an e-commerce or simply to register on a portal, much of our data is part of the databases of websites of all kinds.  As is logical, we all assume that this registration of information occurs once we click on the &#8220;Send&#8221; button, but, <strong>What if there were websites that record everything we write on them?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As we said, it is logical that when you enter your data in a web portal and accept the conditions for their registration, you are assuming that they will be registered where it corresponds.  The problem is that some of the most important websites in the world are recording data as the user is entering it, without the need for more.  A study of several American universities has analyzed <strong>100,000 of the most visited portals<\/strong>and the results can be alarming.<\/p>\n<h2>A compartment similar to keyloggers<\/h2>\n<p>The first and most striking thing about this study is that the results are different depending on whether the user is within the European Union or the United States.  Of the 100,000 portals that we have commented on previously, <strong>1,844<\/strong> that registered the user&#8217;s email in the European Union <strong>without your consent<\/strong>while if the user was on the other side of the pond, there were no more and no less than 2,950 websites that did the same.<\/p>\n<p>To carry out this study, the researchers looked at what is called &#8220;leaky forms&#8221; in English, which is basically a web form that records data without the need for the user to send it. .  This is very similar to the well-known <strong>keylogger<\/strong>, a malicious software that records everything that the user of an infected computer writes, something that can be very damaging to passwords and sensitive data.  In fact, some portals recorded precisely the information entered &#8220;key by key&#8221;, while others recorded the information when the user changed to another field.<\/p>\n<p>The study also places considerable emphasis on the curious <strong>&#8220;regional&#8221; difference in email collection.<\/strong> Although it cannot be proven with certainty, it seems that the great difference between the two territories is due, in essence, to the General Data Protection Regulation that prevails in the European Union, and thanks to which companies have to be quite careful when when processing the data of its users.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1658271\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The importance of the General Data Protection Regulation.<\/p>\n<h2>Meta and TikTok, also affected<\/h2>\n<p>Although not directly, Meta and TikTok have also been affected by this study and that is due to <strong>MetaPixel<\/strong> Y <strong>tik tok pixel<\/strong>, which are the invisible \u201ctrackers\u201d of both platforms that serve to monitor what users do and show them corresponding ads.  The researchers of this study found that these codes were capturing email addresses called &#8220;hashes&#8221;, a version of which allows users to be identified on all platforms.<\/p>\n<p>The study has been able to determine that for American users, <strong>8,438 sites may have been leaking data to Meta through these trackers<\/strong>, and 7,379 for users in the European Union.  As for TikTok, there have been 154 websites for American users compared to 147 from the European Union.  That companies can be done &#8220;so easily&#8221; with our email is something to take into account, as explained by G\u00fcnes Acar, one of the leaders of the study:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The privacy risks for users are that they will be tracked even more efficiently;  they can be tracked across different websites, in different sessions, on mobile and desktop devices.  An email address is a very useful identifier for tracking, because it is global, it is unique, it is constant. <strong>You can&#8217;t delete it like you delete your cookies<\/strong>.  It is a very powerful identifier.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Anyone is already used to entering their data on the Internet.
