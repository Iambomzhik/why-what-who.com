At both the enterprise and end-user level, applications of the caliber of Word, Excel, or PowerPoint are used almost constantly for one task or another.<\/p>\n<p>It is true that over time this suite has had some important competitors, and also free, as in the case of LibreOffice.  But with everything and with it, the proposal offered by the software giant is still the one preferred by the majority.  However, time has shown that although not everyone is predisposed to acquire a <strong>office license<\/strong> or subscribe to <strong>Microsoft 365<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Precisely for this reason, what many do is look for alternative solutions to be able to use all these applications without spending a single euro.  In fact, there are software solutions that allow us to use all of this for free, but that cannot be considered entirely legal.  And there are certain programs that are even considered harmful to the operating system, but that give us access to <strong>payment programs<\/strong> like Office.<\/p>\n<h2>How KMSPico works to use Office for free<\/h2>\n<p>A clear example of all this can be found in one of the most well-known applications in this sense, how it is <strong>KMSPick<\/strong>.  It must be borne in mind that, as is the case with the Windows system of the same firm, <strong>Office requires a license<\/strong> for its legal operation on the computer.  This is the one that we acquire if we pay in order to enjoy the benefits of these applications.  We refer to programs of the importance of Excel, Word or PowerPoint, among other solutions.<\/p>\n<p>This Office license is provided by Microsoft through one of its official channels and distributors, key for which we pay to use the suite.  However, in order to avoid this payment to which we are referring, many users resort to certain illegal activators, as is the case with the one mentioned above.  These are in charge of activating the license in this case of Office and thus have one legally acquired.  Of course, we must not confuse the software solution that is used extensively to <strong>enterprise level KMS<\/strong>with KMSPico.<\/p>\n<p>The first one has been used for a long time, mainly by company system administrators for <strong>activation of certain Microsoft products<\/strong> for multiple teams.  This is a completely legal business tool where <strong>hundreds of keys purchased for use<\/strong> on the workers&#8217; PCs and that expire after 180 days, generally.  But something else different KMSPico.  This is unauthorized software that is responsible for activating the Office license by tricking the software into pretending that we have a key, when this is not the case.<\/p>\n<h2>Risks of using the office suite activator<\/h2>\n<p>Contrary to what some people think, the use of this tool is absolutely not allowed, neither at a personal nor a business level.  What the program does when we run it is create a <strong>emulated key on KMS server<\/strong> that prevents online activation of Office.  This is one of the reasons why most antivirus programs mark this executable as malicious.  This is something that we can clearly see when analyzing KMSPico on the VirusTotal security platform.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if we decide to use this software to activate Office, we may have <strong>future legal problems<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In short, we can say that the aforementioned KMSPico program allows us to activate Office and use the programs that make up the suite for free.  However, this is an action related to software piracy and prosecuted by law.  In addition, we will be working with a program <strong>flagged by most antiviruses<\/strong> as dangerous, with the risks that this entails.  We could say that, despite being possible, it is not recommended at all.  There are other very attractive and interesting alternatives such as the use of <strong>LibreOffice open source office suite<\/strong>for example.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Microsoft office suite, Office, contains some of the most widely used programs around the world.
