Each manufacturer of phones compatible with Google&#8217;s operating system has its own, <strong>but it is always better if we have a choice<\/strong>.  If you were looking to give your phone a change or want to try a new keyboard, we recommend some very interesting options right below.<\/p>\n<h2>gboard<\/h2>\n<p>Although there are very good alternatives and options within Android keyboards, it would be unfair not to say that <strong>Gboard is possibly the best option<\/strong>.  This Google keyboard has everything you could ask for in a mobile keyboard, and much more.<\/p>\n<p>    <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Googles-Gboard-and-other-good-keyboards-for-your-Android-mobile.png\" alt=\"Gboard: Google's keyboard\"\/>     <\/p>\n<p>This keyboard has many customization options and is also quite comfortable.  We will find its best and greatest asset in <strong>the predictive ability of your keyboard<\/strong>, which works incredibly well and is very accurate.  It also has a very good autocorrect similar to Gmail.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1662063\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Googles-Gboard-and-other-good-keyboards-for-your-Android-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"GboardGoogle\" width=\"715\" height=\"358\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition, Gboard has some more &#8220;advanced&#8221; elements such as the possibility of configuring the keyboard to be used with one hand, or setting the number line so that it is always visible.  It also has <strong>a very good writing swipe<\/strong> or with dictation on the fly.<\/p>\n<h2>SwiftKey<\/h2>\n<p>Another great option that we have within this sector is <strong>Microsoft&#8217;s SwiftKey<\/strong>.
