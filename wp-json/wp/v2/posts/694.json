In fact, there are many other similar alternatives, although smaller and limited in terms of games available, there are other game stores that are very worthwhile.  The aforementioned Epic Store is a clear example of this.<\/p>\n<p>As a general rule, these game stores to which we refer can be <strong>use through our internet browser <\/strong>favorite.  However, to get the most out of these stores that we mentioned, it is best to install their client if possible.  Actually, we are talking about the programs that they offer us and that we can install in the operating system to access said store.
