What you should take into account"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The truth is that once we have acquired some experience in this software sector, it can be more than satisfactory.  Especially as we reach certain goals and obtain apparent results.  And we are not only talking about the development of certain applications and programs, we can even get into the <strong>exciting world of game creation<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As we create new projects, our experience grows in this regard.  We tell you this because for many <strong>programming languages \u200b\u200band development environments<\/strong> that you study, here the experience is above all.  It is true that at first it is advisable to have a base that gives us learning and education, but from then on our desire and patience play a fundamental role.  In the event that you are starting or consider yourselves new users in the <strong>software development<\/strong>let&#8217;s see what we should <strong>take into account before starting a new programming project<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>And it is that all this previous preparation, over time, will directly influence both our productivity and the final result that we will obtain.<\/p>\n<h2>What to consider before starting programming<\/h2>\n<p>We must know that everything related to software development requires a good work environment and enthusiasm on our part.  If these first two premises are not fulfilled, possibly the results obtained will not be much less than expected.  Also, before starting a <strong>new project<\/strong> There are several sections that we must take into account to achieve what we want or need.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The ultimate goal to achieve<\/strong>: The first thing we must be clear about before starting the programming project are the objectives to be achieved.  This will depend on our knowledge, means, or the time we are going to use.  Without a doubt, it is not the same to enter a project of these characteristics for personal reasons than professional ones.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use the most suitable programming language<\/strong>: once we have a clear objective to meet, we must inform ourselves about the programming language or platform that interests us the most.  We must bear in mind that we can develop applications and games with services that offer us work without even writing code.  Otherwise, we must choose the language to use well depending on the type of project.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Choosing the perfect IDE or code editor<\/strong>: now we are going to choose the software to use for the development of the programming project as such.  It is worth mentioning that an IDE is a much more complex and complete environment, ideal for new users in these matters.  The most experienced may prefer to opt for a lighter and simpler code editor that offers them more control over the code.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Design an organization chart with the components of the project<\/strong>: after all this and before starting to type, it is preferable to design an organizational chart or graph of the project.  This will allow us to follow the steps until we reach the goal in a more efficient and orderly manner.  The method used here will depend on our creativity and the magnitude of the work we are going to do.  It is worth losing some preparation time here, in time we will appreciate it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The truth is that once we have acquired some experience in this software sector, it can be more than satisfactory.
