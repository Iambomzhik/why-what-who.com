Nowadays, most of the time you receive calls from numbers you don&#8217;t know, it will be because they are spam calls, and they just want to sell you something.  For this reason, we are going to help you find out who owns a number, whether it is from an advertising company or from an individual.<\/p>\n<p>We are going to start by explaining how to identify calls with the internal options of some Android mobiles, although it is not a method that always works.  Then we will tell you <strong>search engines where you can try to find who the numbers belong to<\/strong>and we will end with a notice about apps specialized in number identification.<\/p>\n<h2>Use your mobile identifier<\/h2>\n<p>    <\/p>\n<p>As we said at the beginning, in most cases calls from unknown numbers will be spam.  That is why this first method can be useful to you, although <strong>only some specific manufacturers such as Samsung, Xiaomi, Realme, Vivo or Google include it<\/strong>.  This is an option to filter spam or unwanted calls, and that helps you identify them by showing you who they belong to even if you don&#8217;t have them on the agenda.<\/p>\n<p>To activate this filter, you have to go into the settings of the calling app and look for an option called caller ID and spam, or similar.  Look for the option that references Caller ID or Spam Protection.<\/p>\n<p>here inside, <strong>activates the function of See person and caller ID<\/strong> in the event that your mobile has it, so that the mobile can tell you when a call is advertising, and try to find out which company it belongs to to indicate it on the screen.  You can also enable spam call filtering to block calls from numbers it identifies as spam.<\/p>\n<p>With these measures in the mobiles that include it, you are going to get rid of or be able to identify many of the advertising calls that you receive. <strong>But it won&#8217;t work with all the numbers<\/strong>as there may be some that have not been identified as spam by the phone systems, and hence there are some alternative methods.<\/p>\n<p>    <img src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652867182_929_How-to-find-out-who-owns-a-phone-number.jpg\" alt=\"How to make calls from a hidden number on Android and iPhone\"\/><\/p>\n<h2>Number identification services<\/h2>\n<p>There are many pages of online number identification services on the Internet.  Is about <strong>directories that collect phone numbers and their owners<\/strong>.  So if you have a missed call that you can&#8217;t identify, you can type in the phone number that called you to find out who it belongs to.  Here are some of the most popular pages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google: Ok, this is not a page specialized in collecting numbers and their owners.  However, before using any other you can try <strong>search for that phone number in google<\/strong>.  Believe it or not, at least for identifying spam it can be quite effective.<\/li>\n<li>Yellow Pages: Yes, the usual yellow pages have their own website, and on it you can find <strong>phone numbers for most businesses<\/strong> Spanish people.  So you can just look up the number on their website, and it will search both the Yellow Pages and the old White Pages databases.<\/li>\n<li>Listaspam: This is a directory specialized in the most harassing spam, those numbers that massively call people to sell them things.  If the previous two have not worked for you, this one can also be useful.<\/li>\n<li>Who has called?: It is another directory of information on telephone numbers, and in this case it is updated by the users themselves.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>WhatsApp Web is another good alternative<\/h2>\n<p>  <img class=\"sf-lazy centro_sinmarco\"  src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652867182_413_How-to-find-out-who-owns-a-phone-number.jpg\" alt=\"WhatsApp\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>And what about private numbers?  Almost everyone in Spain has WhatsApp, there is a method to send WhatsApp messages to numbers that you do not have in the phonebook.  All you have to do is open your browser and <strong>write the address wa.me\/telephone number<\/strong>, changing phone number to the number of the person you want to write to.  Remember to put the international code, such as wa.me\/346XXXXXXXX in Spanish numbers, where the code for Spain is +34.<\/p>\n<p>when you do this, <strong>a conversation with the owner of the number will be opened and their profile will be loaded<\/strong>, and in many cases you will be able to see their name or even a photo of them.  Here, <strong>you don&#8217;t need to write anything<\/strong>because just by opening the chat you can already see their data.<\/p>\n<p>    <img src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652867183_436_How-to-find-out-who-owns-a-phone-number.jpg\" alt=\"How to set a ringtone for a contact on Android \"\/><\/p>\n<h2>Beware of apps to identify numbers<\/h2>\n<p>  <img class=\"sf-lazy centro_sinmarco\"  src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652867183_636_How-to-find-out-who-owns-a-phone-number.jpg\" alt=\"apps\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>Another resource that you can use are the various applications to identify numbers, such as TrueCaller and the like.  And they&#8217;re useful, because they really do compile a vast database of phone numbers and their owners.  However, you should know that <strong>can be a serious problem for your privacy<\/strong>both yours and that of all your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that these applications work by collecting contacts, and that they will request access to your calls, SMS and also your contact list.  If you give it to him, among other things <strong>they can collect information about you and your contacts<\/strong> to add them to their databases, and you may not want your number going there or compromising the people who entrusted you with their phone numbers.<\/p>\n<p>So these apps are very useful but bad for privacy.  And TrueCaller can be good as far as it goes, but others that you can find searching in the app store of your mobile may not be so good.  Always be very careful with these tools.<\/p>\n<p>\n   <iframe title=\"C\u00d3MO SABER QUI\u00c9N TE LLAMA DE UN NUMERO DESCONOCIDO  - Identifica qui\u00e9n te llama y BLOQUEA EL SPAM\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/cKlxNSsvup4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>we will explain how can you find out who owns a phone number when they are calling you and you do not have it in the agenda.
