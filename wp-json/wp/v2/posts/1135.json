Many people have kept the same number for years, even if during that time they have changed their operator once or several times.  Having to give all your contacts your new number can be exhausting, so it&#8217;s very important to keep the one you&#8217;ve always had, <strong>even if you are going to be a while without using it<\/strong>.  M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil gives us a very interesting tool for this, and in this article we will tell you more about it.<\/p>\n<p>Leaving our line in the &#8220;refrigerator&#8221; is <strong>an intermediate solution<\/strong> between continuing to pay for it even if we don&#8217;t use it and canceling it definitively.  In this way, what the yellow operator allows us is that we can leave our line suspended for a specific period of time, ideal if, for example, we are going abroad for a long time and we have no thought of taking our telephone line with us.<\/p>\n<h2>This is the M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil parking service<\/h2>\n<p>The service to suspend the M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil line is called <strong>parking service<\/strong>, so called because, as you can imagine, our line is &#8220;parked&#8221;.  With this, what we achieve is to keep our old telephone number without having to pay the corresponding monthly bill.  This service can be activated for up to 6 consecutive months, although of course we can activate our line whenever we want.<\/p>\n<p>As the operator&#8217;s help page explains, this service has <strong>a cost of only 1 euro per month<\/strong> (VAT included).  The parking service is available for all the modalities that M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil has, so you will not have any problems regardless of the rate you have contracted.  Activating it is really simple, and it is that we can do it in a very simple way from home.<\/p>\n<p>For this, we only have to <strong>call the number 2373<\/strong> and request it.  Before doing so, you have to have a couple of important considerations that you should not lose sight of.  The first, and perhaps the most obvious, is that when we activate this parking service, the line will be in limbo, that is, we will not be able to make or receive calls, SMS or use the data associated with our rate.  To all effects, <strong>that phone line will be totally deactivated<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1666542\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil parking service is very useful.<\/p>\n<p>Last but not least, it&#8217;s time to talk about <strong>the rate we have contracted<\/strong>.  If we decide to deactivate our line with this parking service, we must know that M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil does not guarantee that when we return we will be able to maintain it.  If this rate disappears during this time, when we deactivate the parking service we will have to switch to one of the ones that are available at that time.<\/p>\n<p>Reactivating our line does not have much mystery, since for this we will only have to <strong>contact us again with the same phone number<\/strong>.  If you have any questions about this parking service, we recommend that you contact the M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil customer service.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Changing phone numbers can be quite annoying.
