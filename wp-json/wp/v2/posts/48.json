For example, Jazztel has just presented a <strong>flash offer available until May 9, 2022<\/strong> in which the price of fiber speed will be reduced forever by 1,000 Mbps for those who contract before that date.<\/p>\n<p>Jazztel joins other companies that have recently lowered the price of Internet service at home, such as M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil, Orange or Movistar.  The offer will lower 6 euros of each monthly bill forever.<\/p>\n<h2>1,000 Mbps fiber optic for 30.95 euros<\/h2>\n<p>Jazztel&#8217;s promotion lowers its fiber rate by 1,000 Mbps. Its non-promotional price is 36.95 euros per month, but now you can only pay 30.95 euros on each monthly bill.  If you contract the rate before May 9, 2022, that price will be yours forever or until you decide to leave.  In this case, you must wait at least the 12 months that you have permanence.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1625205\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jazztel promotion banner<\/p>\n<p>In this rate you will find a symmetrical fiber service of 1,000 Mbps<strong> along with a landline where you only pay for what you talk<\/strong>, with a rate of 0.1089 euros per minute + 0.217 euros for call set-up for calls to landlines, or 0.2414 euros per minute with the same set-up figure for calls to mobiles.  Includes installation, WiFi router and line fee included totally free.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to contract it, you have it available directly on the Jazztel website (it is not a secret rate, much less) or you can call 900 905 989 to find out about any questions you may have.<\/p>\n<h2>Is 1,000 Mbps the best fiber deal?<\/h2>\n<p>Despite this attractive price, it&#8217;s not going to be the best 1,000 Mbps or 1 Gbps fiber optic deal you&#8217;ll find on the market today, as competition in this speed bracket is starting to get pretty fierce.  However, we are talking about differences of 1 euro and you will have to decide between other factors.<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1506864\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1506864\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Jazztel-lowers-its-optical-fiber-to-1000-Mbps.jpg\" alt=\"Fiber for 30 euros\" width=\"715\" height=\"374\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1506864\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fiber for 30 euros<\/p>\n<p>You will find the best price in <strong>Ol\u00e9Phone<\/strong>, who use Vodafone coverage.  This operator is currently offering a promotion of &#8220;1000 Mb at the price of 300 Mb&#8221; whereby your fiber Internet rate up to 1,000 Mbps is reduced to a price of 29.95 euros per month forever.<\/p>\n<p>The next option for those looking for 1 Gbps fiber optics is <strong>digi<\/strong>.  The Romanian operator offers Movistar fiber at a price of 30 euros per month.  If you also live in an area where they have their own fiber network deployed, you can even get an even better price of 20 euros per month, although this area is still very small, especially outside of Madrid.  Here the advantage is that you would only have a stay of 3 months and that the price is fixed and does not depend on hiring during the promotional period.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Although more and more users choose to contract convergent fiber and mobile rates, operators do not stop presenting different types of offers to contract only fiber.
