Despite this, the wheel kept turning, and of course we had to quickly adapt to working from home.  The pandemic seems to be coming to an end, but one of the consequences it has left in its wake is <strong>a fairly considerable boom in telecommuting<\/strong> as a permanent way of working, and Vodafone, aware of this, has just launched a very interesting package for it.<\/p>\n<p>With it, the red operator seeks to greatly facilitate the experience of working away from work centers <strong>both professionals and SMEs<\/strong>thanks to a package that includes a wide variety of services at a very competitive price, as you can see a little further down.<\/p>\n<h2>This is the new Vodafone Telecommuting Pack<\/h2>\n<p>The creation of this package responds to an extensive study carried out by the operator, thanks to which it has been possible to verify first-hand how the transition from the pre-pandemic work model to one where teleworking may be the permanent option has been.  This study has shown that there has been <strong>a 68% increase in telecommuting<\/strong>and such an &#8220;explosion&#8221; logically demands that various services and equipment be available to work from home.<\/p>\n<p>For this reason, this new package offered by Vodafone Business, under the name of <strong>Vodafone Telecommuting Pack<\/strong>, seeks precisely to respond to these needs.  This package includes a wide variety of services that today are essential to work, so it makes it extremely easy to get hold of them without having to go to different sites for it.  The Vodafone Telecommuting Pack <strong>Includes the following<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vodafone One Plus Bundle<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With this package we will take home a 600 MB symmetrical fiber and a main line with unlimited data and calls.  In addition, One Plus includes a second free unlimited additional line for one year, and the Vodafone TV Seriefans or Familyfans pack to choose from with a decoder included, One Number and Secure Net.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Office 365 Business Edition<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This Microsoft tool includes everything to make working as a team from home as easy as possible.  This solution allows Microsoft Office to be installed on up to 5 different devices, in addition to including Microsoft Office online, online meetings through Teams, storage with OneDrive and SharePoint as a collaboration space.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A laptop and wireless headphones<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Vodafone Telecommuting Pack includes the Huawei Matebook D14, a rather interesting laptop that includes Windows 11 as standard and has an Intel Core i5, 8 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage.  In addition, we will also be taking a Microsoft Modern wireless headset.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1675755\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Huawei MateBook D14<\/p>\n<h2>A complete package at a good price<\/h2>\n<p>With this proposal, the red operator seeks to become a benchmark for anyone who has telecommuting as their main or permanent way of working.  In the words of <strong>Daniel Jimenez<\/strong>, <strong>Director of Vodafone Business<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are convinced that this proposal will have a great reception among professionals who now also work from home, because it is a comprehensive solution that offers the services that are needed every day to work more efficiently and with total connectivity.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, this package offers practically everything one might need to work from home, and even includes solutions to be able to work collaboratively.  Vodafone Telecommuting Pack arrives at the great price of <strong>83.45 euros per month for the first 12 months<\/strong>, then going on to cost 100.96 euros per month (VAT not included).  If you have any questions regarding this new pack, or any other Vodafone business solution, we recommend that you contact their customer service.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The arrival of the coronavirus forced us to spend several months without leaving home.
