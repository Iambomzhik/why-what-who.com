Microsoft has been working for some time on what will be the first major update to its operating system, an update that, by the way, is almost ready and that we will know as 22H2.  But this does not stop here.  And it is that users signed up for the Dev channel of the Insider program have just received a new build, with new numbering, which clearly marks the development of the 2023 update for the operating system.  We introduce you to <strong>Windows 11 23H2<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>These two new updates are now available to all users signed up for the Microsoft Insider program.  The first of them, the <strong>build 22621<\/strong>belongs to the Beta branch of the operating system, and is focused on giving the final touches to the development of the 22H2 update of the operating system, while the second of them, the <strong>build 25115<\/strong> resumes the development of the Dev branch, presenting the first novelties designed for the 2023 update of the operating system.  If we belong to either of these two Insider channels, we can now install these updates to test their new features directly from Windows Update.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<h2>Windows 11 Beta: build 22621<\/h2>\n<p>The 2022 update for Windows 11 is already finished, so the latest builds that reach users targeted at the Beta branch of the operating system only bring some improvements and fixes, but no new features.  Thus, this update only brings some corrections of errors detected and reported by users, the most important being:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved speech recognition in all related functions.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed error 0x800703E6 when copying files from Google Drive.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed an issue that caused explorer.exe to crash when using Control + Alt + Delete.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed several bugs related to the taskbar.<\/li>\n<li>The Windows Defender Security app should no longer crash when configuring Intelligent Application Control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This version also includes two new bugs that will need to be fixed in future updates before the update reaches all users:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some full screen applications do not let us see the subtitles.<\/li>\n<li>When closing a program, and launching the live subtitles, this program can automatically open again on top of the subtitles.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Users already using this beta channel will no longer see the watermark in the bottom right corner of the screen, which means, once again, that the 22H2 update is now in its final stages.  Also, if we want to try this version quickly, either on a PC or in a virtual machine, without having to update the computer completely, we will be able to download the new Insider ISO directly from this link.<\/p>\n<h2>Windows 11 build 25115: what&#8217;s new for 2023<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to the beta, Microsoft has already released a new update belonging to the Insider Dev channel. We remind you that this is the most advanced, and unstable, channel for the development of the operating system, so, leaving the development of 22H2 on hold, the new build 25115 already belongs to the future of the operating system, that is, to the 2023 update.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to this build we can already know what will be the first novelty of the next Windows update: the \u00abSuggested actions\u00bb or \u00ab<strong>Suggested Actions<\/strong>\u00ab.  Thanks to them we will be able to perform quick tasks (similar to how we can do on Android and iOS) when selecting certain content.  For example, by selecting a phone number we can start the call, or by selecting a date or time, we can create a new event.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-745119\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652605782_441_this-is-the-first-novelty-of-2023.jpg\" alt=\"Suggestions build 25115 Windows 11\" width=\"712\" height=\"442\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Microsoft has also updated the icons of the <strong>Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)<\/strong> for this new version.  And, as expected, it has fixed several bugs detected in the operating system.  In addition to those corrected in build 22621, they also include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed explorer.exe crashes when closing an explorer window.<\/li>\n<li>Improved performance when opening &#8220;Home&#8221; from the browser.<\/li>\n<li>Improved the contrast of the CPU meter in the task manager so that when it is at 100%, it is not unreadable.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed a bug that could leave the Memory Integrity module disabled after a reboot.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Also, among the errors detected in this new version of Windows, we can highlight the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some games that use Easy Anti-Cheat crash or may cause system errors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is how the development of Windows 11 23H2 begins.
