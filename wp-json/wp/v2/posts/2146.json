Similarly, in the past the tool has already started limiting the number of times a WhatsApp message could be forwarded, while in July 2018 the app first announced that it would restrict this feature to a user. <strong>maximum of 20 chats<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>But there is a solution, and more than one, in fact.  This will do because we have a <strong>alternative method<\/strong> to forward a message on WhatsApp without that tip off.<\/p>\n<h2>Ways to remove this tip-off<\/h2>\n<p>And it is that the content that is forwarded appears in the conversation with a label located at the top that indicates that the message was not created by the sender.  The courier company made the decision to implement this measure to limit the spread <strong>fake news<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, you will have to know that this will only work with elements that we can share, that is <strong>audio and images<\/strong>So, stick around to see how we can forward WhatsApp messages without the &#8216;Forwarded&#8217; label appearing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<h3>Use the Share option<\/h3>\n<p>The truth is that it is quite easy to get rid of the label in question.  If what we want to share is multimedia content, instead of clicking on the arrow pointing to the right that accompanies it, we will use the <strong>&#8216;Share&#8217; option.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On Android it is located at the top right (three interconnected points), while on iPhone we must click on the message and then, at the bottom left, on the icon of an arrow inscribed in a square.  Finally we choose &#8216;Share&#8217; and select both the application that interests us (in this case WhatsApp) and the <strong>contact with whom to interact<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In this sense, in the forwarded WhatsApp message, the share option often disappears, so here we already have to open that image or video <strong>from the gallery<\/strong> of our mobile to be able to share it from there to avoid it being marked as &#8216;Forwarded&#8217;.<\/p>\n<h3>The &#8216;official&#8217; method: Copy<\/h3>\n<p>Of course: to avoid the mass dissemination of messages, WhatsApp limits the forwarding of messages to a <strong>maximum of five chats<\/strong> at once.  And, as we said, &#8220;messages you forward that weren&#8217;t written by you will display a &#8216;Forwarded&#8217; label, which will be visible to both you and the recipient.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This WhatsApp trick is very simple.  It basically consists of using an alternative route.  If we cannot use the Forward function, we will use another similar one: Copy.  With photos, videos and files, this WhatsApp trick works very well.  However, you may not see the option to Share with text messages or links.  In that case, you simply have to select the content by clicking on it and then <strong>click on copy<\/strong>.  Once done, just go to the destination conversation and paste said message.<\/p>\n<p>On Android the copy option will appear as two overlapping squares on the top right.  On iPhone we have to press and hold on the text and choose &#8216;Copy&#8217; in the pop-up menu.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1651689 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653411197_107_Use-these-tricks-to-forward-WhatsApp-messages-without-appearing-as.jpg\" alt=\"Share Copy WhatsApp Forwarded\" width=\"768\" height=\"425\"  \/><\/p>\n<h3>Forwarding of text messages and links in WhatsApp<\/h3>\n<p>In the case that we want to send messages of <strong>text or links<\/strong>, we will have seen that the sharing option does not appear as it appears with multimedia files.  To do this, we have another trick that will work for us if we want to forward a text or a link without it being forwarded below.<\/p>\n<p>The functionality we are talking about is simply the one from before, the copy option.  With the copy option, we can forward the text or the link without any problem.
