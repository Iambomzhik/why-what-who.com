Simyo increases the data of its rates at the same price"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>This MVNO owned by Orange offers a mobile offer<strong> very configurable<\/strong>.  With this, each user can access a more suitable offer for him, either with more minutes to call, or more gigabytes to browse.  This is a great incentive to have a mobile phone line with them, or also, of course, to get us a convergent offer.  When it comes to navigation data, the operator is currently offering 6 different options that are quite interesting, but it seems that all of them could become much better in the coming days.<\/p>\n<h2>This is how Simyo&#8217;s rates will remain<\/h2>\n<p>As we have told you just before, Simyo&#8217;s data offer presents several modular options.  If we go to its website and look at the rate configurator, we can see how Orange&#8217;s MVNO offers 100 MB, 7 GB, 14 GB, 25 GB and 35 GB.  If any customer needs a mobile line just to call and does not want any type of data bonus, there is also the possibility of <strong>take only minutes<\/strong>thus saving us some money per month.<\/p>\n<p>Now while this data bonus offer is already pretty good, Simyo is gearing up to give it an extra boost.  The company is sending its users an SMS informing them that <strong>starting next June 1<\/strong> will have an increase in their data bonus.  This improvement is completely automatic, so you will not have to do anything to activate it.  Below you can see an example of this SMS, which in this case improves <strong>a data bonus from 7 GB to 12 GB<\/strong>without price increase in between.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">@miguelon_gm You already know us, we love to give you good news \ud83d\ude09 Enjoy the high \ud83d\udc4d<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 simyo Spain (@simyo_es) May 17, 2022<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Luckily, this bonus will not be the only one that expands from next June 1, and it is that <strong>the rest that Simyo has will do the same<\/strong>.  The good news is that this improvement will affect both new and existing customers, as well as prepaid or contract users (with mobile only or with mobile and fiber).  If we take as an example the rates with unlimited calls, the improvements would be the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>From 7 GB it goes to <strong>12GB<\/strong> (7.5 euros)<\/li>\n<li>From 14 GB it goes to <strong>20GB<\/strong> (10 euros)<\/li>\n<li>From 25 GB it goes to <strong>40GB<\/strong> (14 euros)<\/li>\n<li>From 35 GB it goes to <strong>100GB<\/strong> (20 euros)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In this way, Simyo&#8217;s offer grows and matches its direct competition.  This operator starts with an advantage because it also includes some quite interesting things such as the possibility of <strong>accumulate megabytes without spending for 3 months<\/strong>.  Below you can see a table with how your mobile offer would be configured with the updated data vouchers:<\/p>\n<table id=\"tablepress-478\" class=\"tablepress table-block block-collapse-amp tablepress-id-478\">\n<tr class=\"row-1 odd\">\n<th class=\"column-1\">minutes\/calls<\/th>\n<th class=\"column-2\">data vouchers<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tbody class=\"row-hover\">\n<tr class=\"row-2 even\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">Calls 6 cents\/minute<br \/>(18 cents establishment)<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">No data: 0 euros<br \/>100MB: \u20ac1<br \/>12GB: 4 euros<br \/>20 GB: 6 euros<br \/>40GB: \u20ac9<br \/>100GB: \u20ac15.50<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3 odd\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">20 minutes<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">Without data: 1 euro<br \/>100MB: \u20ac2<br \/>12GB: 5 euros<br \/>20 GB: 7 euros<br \/>40GB: \u20ac10<br \/>100GB: \u20ac16.50<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-4 even\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">50 minutes<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">Without data: 2.50 euros<br \/>100MB: \u20ac3.50<br \/>12GB: \u20ac6.50<br \/>40GB: \u20ac11.50<br \/>100GB: \u20ac18<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-5 odd\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">100 minutes<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">Without data: 3.50 euros<br \/>100MB: \u20ac4.50<br \/>20GB: \u20ac7.50<br \/>40GB: \u20ac12.50<br \/>100GB: \u20ac19<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-6 even\">\n<td class=\"column-1\">Unlimited calls<\/td>\n<td class=\"column-2\">12GB: \u20ac7.50<br \/>20 GB: 10 euros<br \/>40 GB: 14 euros<br \/>100GB: \u20ac20<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h2>A convergent offer that comes out enhanced<\/h2>\n<p>As is logical, this increase in the gigabytes of Simyo&#8217;s rates also has a direct impact on the mobile + fiber offers, making it much more solid in general.  These, as we will be able to see below, have quite competent prices and where even the options with 100 GB of data stand out, <strong>starting at 35.99 euros per month<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>All these convergent rates include <strong>a stay of 3 months for fiber<\/strong>.  It should be noted that Simyo also offers installment mobiles with these rates, so if you don&#8217;t have one or want something new, you also have the option.  If you want additional lines, you can contract them at a price that ranges from 4 euros per month (20 minutes and 4 GB) to 12 euros per month (unlimited minutes and 100 GB).
