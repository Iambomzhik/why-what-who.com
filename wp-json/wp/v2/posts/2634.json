The best thing is that the service can be equivalent to ADSL and Internet Radio if you don&#8217;t have fiber coverage.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>Movistar usually launches promotions with a 20% discount for 6 months in the 300 Mb mode.

On the one hand, 300 Mb fiber with landline with unlimited calls to national landlines, line fee included, free installation and Smart WiFi router for 24 euros per month for 12 months, after which the price will be 38 euros per month.  On the other hand, if we need higher speed, the option of 600 Mb is also available for 44 euros per month of final price without promotion.<\/p>\n<h2>satellite internet<\/h2>\n<p>Companies like <strong>Eurona or Viasat do have a commitment to stay for 12 months<\/strong>since they require a more extensive installation than other cable Internet connections, so we are going to discard them automatically.<\/p>\n<p> <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1114920\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1114920\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653776393_799_What-options-do-we-have-besides-Movistar.jpg\" alt=\"satellite internet\" width=\"715\" height=\"460\"  \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1114920\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">satellite internet<\/p>\n<p>Our option here is SkyDSL, whose installation is not that complex and, therefore, they do not require permanence, but they do have an initial registration fee of 29.90 euros for activation\/registration of the service.
