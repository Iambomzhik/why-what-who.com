This means, quite the opposite of what the Seville &#8217;92 Expo meant (for example), where after two days, the city was full of pavilions from all the countries that did not know what to do with them.<\/p>\n<p>The Barcelona&#8217;92 Olympics did not disappear then.  The Picornell swimming pools, the Palau Sant Jordi, the Velodrome, the Llu\u00eds Companys Stadium, etc., all the constructions, some new and others remodeled, have witnessed countless sporting events over the years;  the 2000 and 2009 Davis Cup (Palau Sant Jordi), the Barcelona &#8217;03 Swimming World Championships (Picornell and Sant Jordi), the Barcelona &#8217;10 European Athletics Championships (Llu\u00eds Companys) and some more, in addition to those that will be held in years to come.  Barcelona has been a city that has been completely infected with sport and has committed itself year after year to making its projects from 20 years ago profitable.<\/p>\n<p>I hope that if Madrid is chosen as the Olympic venue in 2020, this is just the tip of the iceberg of a long work with a view to the future.  It has emblematic constructions (the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u or Vicente Calder\u00f3n fields, or the Caja M\u00e1gica de Tenis), which are recognized throughout the world.  Also ambitious projects (the swimming pools of El Escorial) that can be very useful in the future.  Madrid needs to experience sport and work so that as many international events as possible can be played, either with or without the Games.<\/p>\n<p>If it is from this perspective of continuity, it is clear that the Games have all the ballots to be profitable.  Something that did not happen in Athens&#8217;04, where a year after the Olympic flame went out, the stadium was completely abandoned. <\/p>\n<p>_________________<br \/><i>&#8220;The most important thing in sport is not to win, but to participate, because the essential thing in life is not success, but to strive to achieve it.&#8221;<\/i> Pierre de Coubertin (1863-1937)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I think that it can be profitable in the long term if a continuity project is carried out.
