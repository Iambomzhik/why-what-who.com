You have to clean the TV from time to time, <strong>But not in any way<\/strong>.  It&#8217;s more;  the best recommendation is that we do not do it as with any furniture, but in a detailed and careful way.<\/p>\n<h2>Prevent damage to your TV screen<\/h2>\n<p>The desire to improve the image quality of television has led to a constant evolution of the screen.  The definition is getting higher, but the delicacy of these has also increased.  Therefore, it is necessary to treat them with special care and clean them with specific products for <strong>Avoid damages<\/strong>scratches and even damage.<\/p>\n<p>The plasma screen dominates the television market and is found in most homes in recent years.  These types of screens are here to stay for a long time, so you will be interested in knowing what the best tricks are to clean them.<\/p>\n<p>Contrary to what happens with common electronics, these often lead to these devices having a <strong>much shorter shelf life<\/strong>.  That is why we must treat them with care, and strive to clean and protect them.<\/p>\n<h2>what tricks are there<\/h2>\n<p>Frequently cleaning the screen of a flat screen television will allow us to <strong>enjoy the picture quality<\/strong> that it can offer in its entirety and, in addition, will help it last longer in perfect condition.<\/p>\n<p>With different types, the vast majority that we can find today are of the latest technology and <strong>hypersensitive Touch, <\/strong>like Smart TVs.  Gone are those televisions with rounded screens and large plastic covers.  In any case, whether it is an LCD, LCD-Led, OLED or plasma screen, it is best to follow the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions in the instruction manual, especially before purchasing a specific commercial product for this task.<\/p>\n<h3>Use a cloth and isopropyl alcohol<\/h3>\n<p>The TV is hardly touched, but it does tend to get dusty.  In principle, and if the screen does not have stains, passing a microfiber cloth will be enough to remove the dust from the television.  But, if the screen of your Smart TV shows fingerprints, grease stains or dirt, use liquids such as <strong>isopropyl alcohol<\/strong> (used for disinfectants, cleaners and detergents).<\/p>\n<p>Whether your TV screen is LCD, LCD-Led, OLED or plasma, follow these steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn off the television.<\/li>\n<li>Moisten the cloth with isopropyl alcohol (you can also add distilled water to it).<\/li>\n<li>Run the cloth over the television screen, always <strong>from top to bottom<\/strong>.  Try not to put too much pressure.  Immediately you will notice how your screen stays shiny.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<h3>Microfiber cloths&#8230; but always with a cold TV<\/h3>\n<p>Whatever we have at home, surely you agree that it is not good to sit down to watch television, and instead of watching your favorite program, be distracted by the <strong>streaks on the screen<\/strong> (product of inadequate cleaning) or by dust.  In addition, this equipment is usually very sophisticated and requires special care and cleaning.<\/p>\n<p>That is why it is important that we use, for example, other products.  These can be microfiber cloths, which will protect and pamper the television screen.  In this sense, try to avoid kitchen paper, tissues or toilet paper as they usually leave residue and then these can scratch the TV screen.  In any case, you should always clean the screen while it is off and disconnected from the power supply.  If you have had them on, let them cool down for at least <strong>15 minutes.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>beware of chemicals<\/h3>\n<p>All in all, the most recommended product to clean the television screen, and keep it intact, is a dry, soft and easy to handle cloth.  In the same way, and as something important, it is also important to be careful with chemical products, especially those that are more aggressive.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beware of <strong>chemical products<\/strong>.  Unless the product label recommends their use, never use chemical cleaners, polishes, or abrasives such as alcohol, benzene, ammonia, acetone, or paint thinners.  Also, do not use furniture cleaning products because they contain components that can discolor your screen or cause the image to lose sharpness.<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid of <strong>alcohol<\/strong>.  If we use it correctly, we can use alcohol to clean and disinfect frequently used objects, including the television screen.  However, for screen cleaning it should be isopropyl alcohol, which evaporates much faster than regular alcohol.  Under no point of view use ethyl alcohol as this can damage the screen.<\/li>\n<li>Consider the use of <strong>distilled water<\/strong>.  Mix equal parts distilled water and white vinegar.  Pour the solution into a spray bottle and use a few drops on a cloth.  When you think about how to clean a Smart TV, remember that you should never spray the screen directly.<\/li>\n<li>take care of the <strong>borders<\/strong> and the back.  With a dry cloth clean the edges, the base and the back.  Also gently brush it across the screen to remove any dust.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The television screen, like all the furniture in the house, gets dusty, dirty&#8230; and if we have small children it can get stained by worse things.
