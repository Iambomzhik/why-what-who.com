Among the information that the program shows us, it is worth highlighting:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Health condition<\/strong>: is responsible for making an average of all the values \u200b\u200band tells us what state the disk is in.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Temperature<\/strong>: from here it shows us the temperature of the disk, so to avoid problems it is convenient that it be as low as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Device Overview<\/strong>: In this section we can see the brand, model, firmware, operating time and other general information about the HDD or SSD.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Individual SMART information<\/strong>: here, we can see the status of each of the points controlled by the SMART to know if, although the disk appears to be fine, there is a point where it could fail.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the upper part we find several tabs, where it is convenient to highlight its section of <strong>Function<\/strong>from where, we find the different functions that we can carry out with the program.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>From here we have different options to determine how and how often the program data is refreshed.  It also has the function of <strong>Graph<\/strong> from where we can see the behavior of the available memories.  We can also<strong> hide serial number<\/strong>something that can be very useful if we are going to share screenshots of the program.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-728037 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653835913_327_Know-all-the-data-on-the-hard-drive-or-SSD.jpg\" alt=\"CrystalDiskInfo Advanced Options\" width=\"900\" height=\"898\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Another interesting section is its <strong>Advanced Options<\/strong> from where we will be able to configure the temperature scale, the waiting time to start the program, carry out an advanced search for hard drives or hide the information that SMART offers us.<\/p>\n<h2>Is it worth using?<\/h2>\n<p>This software is responsible for providing us with a complete reading of all the SMART information of our PC, as well as the current temperature and its health status.  It has a clear interface that makes it easy for us to find all the information we need.  On the contrary, it is also worth mentioning that unless we have a certain knowledge of the information that it shows us, we will not be able to deduce much from it, since it does not have any help or explanation function for the data that it offers.  That is why in order to take full advantage of it, it must be used mainly by <strong>Advanced users<\/strong>.  In this case, you apply with an excellent free option.<\/p>\n<h2>Free download<\/h2>\n<p>CrystalDiskInfo is a<strong> free Software,<\/strong> so we can use it without having to pay a single euro, by simply downloading it from its official website.  The program is compatible with Windows in its different versions up to Windows 11, as well as with 32-bit and 64-bit systems.<\/p>\n<p>It has three download options since we can choose from different skins: Standard Edition, Shizuku Edition and Kurei Kei Edition.  All the options are identical in terms of the software content, since it only modifies the aesthetic section.  In each of the versions we will have up to four sections for downloading the program, either compressed or uncompressed, as well as installable or portable.<\/p>\n<p>Of course we will recommend the <strong>wearable version,<\/strong> since it does not require installation and therefore does not modify the Windows registry.  In addition, we can run it directly from any external storage device such as a hard drive, a flash drive, or even a memory card.<\/p>\n<h2>Other alternatives<\/h2>\n<p>If we are looking for a program with which we can find out the status of our hard drive or SSD, we can also opt for one of these alternatives to CrystalDiskInfo:<\/p>\n<h3>HD Tune<\/h3>\n<p>We are talking about a program with which we can carry out a visual analysis of our hard drive and check its internal behavior.  It also scans your SMART data as well as your bad sectors.  In addition, it is also used to measure the temperature of the HDD or SSD and its hours of use.  We can download HD Tune from the developer&#8217;s website.<\/p>\n<h3>DiskCheckup<\/h3>\n<p>It is a program with which we are going to be able to carry out basic diagnostic work on the state of the storage units that we have on our computer, being able to monitor the SMART data, and even configure alarms so that the program notifies us in the event that the hard drive reaches a high temperature.  If we want to try DiskCheckup, we can download it from its main web page.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A hard drive can fail for various reasons, and one of the most important can be found in the excessive temperature to which we submit them when we work with the PC, and this is where an application like CrystalDiskInfo can be very useful, since it will offer us a good amount of data in [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2720,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2717"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2717"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2717\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2720"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2717"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2717"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2717"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
