Even if you change the language of Windows by adding Spanish, the keyboard still does not have \u00d1, how can you write it?<\/p>\n<p>we will explore <strong>several alternatives to write \u00d1<\/strong> when your keyboard doesn&#8217;t have the key.  We&#8217;ll focus on \u00d1, but you can really use this information for other &#8220;special&#8221; letters like stressed vowels, umlauts, or cedilla.<\/p>\n<h2>Option 1: copying it to the clipboard<\/h2>\n<p>  <img class=\"sf-lazy derecha_sinmarco\"  src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/How-to-write-the-letter-N-if-your-keyboard-does.jpg\" alt=\"Copy\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>If you just need to write a couple of \u00d1 and don&#8217;t feel like making things up, one of the fastest ways to do it is to simply <strong>copying<\/strong> to the Clipboard letters \u00d1 of a web page and <strong>sticking them<\/strong> in your document. <\/p>\n<p>If it is your chosen option, here you have both versions <strong>upper case and lower case<\/strong>: \u00f1 and \u00d1, because generally you can&#8217;t change the letter easily unless you&#8217;re in an advanced editor like Word.<\/p>\n<h2>Option 2: with your code<\/h2>\n<p>  <img class=\"sf-lazy centro_sinmarco\"  src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/How-to-write-the-letter-N-if-your-keyboard-does.png\" alt=\"G613 Wireless Mechanical Gaming Keyboard\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>Another option at your disposal is to add them using <strong>combinations of keys and numbers that identify the letter \u00d1<\/strong>.  Each letter on the keyboard has its own code, so you can use this code even if your keyboard doesn&#8217;t have the key.  The code is different for lowercase and uppercase \u00f1.  They are the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>uppercase \u00d1:<\/strong> ALT + 0209<\/li>\n<li><strong>lowercase \u00f1:<\/strong> ALT+0241<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That is, to write &#8216;\u00d1&#8217; you must hold down the ALT key on your keyboard and then type 0209 in <strong>the numeric keypad<\/strong>.  The shortcut will not work if you use the &#8220;normal&#8221; numbers, that is, the ones above the keys Q, W, E, R&#8230; You must use the numbers on the numeric keypad, which are the numbers on the right of the keyboard.<\/p>\n<h2>Option 3: with the virtual keyboard<\/h2>\n<p>  <img class=\"sf-lazy centro_sinmarco\"  src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652799647_638_How-to-write-the-letter-N-if-your-keyboard-does.jpg\" alt=\"Osk\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>Another option at your disposal is the Windows virtual keyboard.  Like the keyboard on your Android or iOS mobile, the virtual keyboard is displayed on the screen itself.  To open the Windows virtual keyboard, press the keys at the same time <strong>Windows + R<\/strong> To open the Run dialog, type <strong>ok<\/strong> and click OK.<\/p>\n<p>  <img class=\"sf-lazy centro_sinmarco\"  src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652799648_737_How-to-write-the-letter-N-if-your-keyboard-does.jpg\" alt=\"Osk\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>The Windows virtual keyboard changes its settings according to the currently active input language, so if Windows is set to Spanish it will display the letter \u00d1.  To add it, <strong>click the \u00d1 on the virtual keyboard<\/strong>as if it were a real keyboard.<\/p>\n<h2>Option 4: pressing its equivalent key<\/h2>\n<p>  <img class=\"sf-lazy centro_sinmarco\"  src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652799648_194_How-to-write-the-letter-N-if-your-keyboard-does.jpg\" alt=\"Oskin\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>The last option is simple: even if the \u00d1 key is not physically on your keyboard, <strong>the key that takes its place on the keyboard<\/strong> will write \u00d1 if Windows is configured with Spanish input.  This will usually be the key to the right of the &#8216;L&#8217;, which on the English keyboard is the semicolon.<\/p>\n<p>The same applies to any other specific letter of the Spanish keyboard, and in this way you will be able to write in Spanish using accents, \u00d1 and \u00e7 with a keyboard in another language.  It can be a bit confusing, which is why some people prefer to buy stickers like these that stick on top of the keys. <\/p>\n<p>In Xataka Basics |  How to change the language of Microsoft Office to put it in Spanish<\/p>\n<p>    <img alt=\"Spanish Keyboard Stickers - Superior Quality\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652799648_931_How-to-write-the-letter-N-if-your-keyboard-does.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n<p class=\"pivot-ecommerce-desc\">Spanish Keyboard Stickers &#8211; Superior Quality<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today we will see what you can do to write the letter \u00d1 if you have an English keyboard or laptop or any other language that does not include the physical key.
