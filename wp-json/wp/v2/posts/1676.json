Eris is a rocket that will be made up of three stages.

Liquid rocket engines are more prevalent than you might think.  For example, the famous company Space X also uses them.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1670658\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gilmour liquid rocket<\/p>\n<p>Rockets produce thrust by burning propellants and expelling the products (gases) of combustion from the engine.  In the case of liquid rockets, they have the advantage that their reasonably high density allows the volume of propellant storage tanks to be relatively low, and light centrifugal turbopumps can be used to drive propellant from the tanks into the chamber. combustion, which means that <strong>propellants can be kept at low pressure<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Liquid rocket engines are notoriously <strong>complex and expensive to develop<\/strong>, so this could reduce costs while testing reliability.  &#8220;With this key test, we are proud to say that Gilmour Space has demonstrated sovereign capability on two different rocket systems,&#8221; said Gilmour.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of \u200b\u200bthe liquid-fueled rocket as understood in the modern context first appears in the book &#8220;The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Reaction Devices&#8221; by the Russian school teacher <strong>Konstantin Tsiolkovsky<\/strong>.
