Insiders are sure that the Pixel Notepad will be presented later this year.<\/p>\n<h2>Google is planning a foldable Pixel similar to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold<\/h2>\n<p>Once again someone who is known from the display industry reports.  He, Ross Young, says the Google Pixel Notepad is similar to the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. However, Google relies on a slightly smaller cover display on the outside.  There is talk of 5.8 inches, while Samsung is said to be using a screen diagonal of 6.19 inches.  The large foldable display on the inside will be somewhere between 7 and 8 inches.<\/p>\n<p>A few days ago there was already a tentative hint of new form factors in the Google Pixel area.  Again and again there is talk of a device that will only start in the USA for the time being.  Graphics had already appeared in Google&#8217;s source codes that would support previous information.  And at almost the same time, good sources have informed that Google is said to have chosen \u201cPixel Notepad\u201d as the name.<\/p>\n<p>Google Pixel Notepad graphic<\/p>\n<p>This is known about the Pixel Notepad so far:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Foldable with a large display on the inside<\/li>\n<li>Screen diagonal: approx. 6 inches outside, approx. 8 inches inside<\/li>\n<li>Price should be below the competition<\/li>\n<li>Most likely with Google Tensor<\/li>\n<li>Camera probably rather older model<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>show more<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\" placeholder=\"\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Z Fold 4 and Google foldable will have similar sized foldable displays, but the Google cover display will be quite a bit smaller at 5.8&#8243;. This should mean it will have a wider aspect ratio than the Samsung 6.19&#8243; Fold 4.
