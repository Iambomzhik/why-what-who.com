Today, more than 50% of our customers have seen their mobile coverage improve, and it positions us as leaders in the sector since we have the lowest rate of time without coverage in the entire market&#8221;, highlights Norberto Ojinaga, Network Director of the Group Euskaltel.<\/p>\n<p>Last December, M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil announced that it had already migrated one million customers to Yoigo&#8217;s coverage, but this time it is about their complete migration.<\/p>\n<h2>Choice of mobile network<\/h2>\n<p>M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil also highlighted at the time when the friendly takeover bid was confirmed that the jump to the new coverage will include an automatic selection service that will guarantee migrated customers the best coverage available at all times, provided they are in areas where both Orange and Yoigo had direct coverage.  This will make even more sense in the near future, since it must be remembered that in the future there will be a merger between M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil and Orange.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1648872\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Map Euskaltel Virgin R<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are very happy to be able to offer our customers tangible benefits in a very short time.
