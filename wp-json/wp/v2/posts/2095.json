Take advantage of these help from Microsoft"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>It is true that among the most widely used programs globally is the popular text editor, <strong>Microsoft Word<\/strong>.  It is considered one of the main benchmarks in the office automation sector and is almost essential software for most computers.  But this does not mean that it is exempt from possible performance problems.<\/p>\n<p>There are many other similar alternatives, even free ones, that compete head-to-head with the programs on the <strong>office-suite<\/strong>.  However, this is still the most used and widespread.  The aforementioned text editor is accompanied by other well-known applications such as Excel or PowerPoint from the same company.  They have been with us for many years and the software giant does not stop improving these solutions so that they adapt to the majority of users.<\/p>\n<p>In this way, the suite can actually be found in both end-user and company computers.  However, as we say, something quite common in the software sector, the aforementioned programs <strong>they are not perfect nor are they free from possible flaws<\/strong>.  All this despite the efforts and work of a company of the caliber of Microsoft.  If we focus on Word, these errors can become a serious problem, especially if we use it at a business level.  In addition, these problems can be caused by the software as such, by our way of using it, or due to certain <strong>incompatibilities<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Precisely for all this, the giant Microsoft offers us a series of aids in the form of <strong>functions integrated into the text editor itself<\/strong>.  All this trying to solve the possible problems that we find as soon as possible and effectively.<\/p>\n<h2>Ask Microsoft for help for Word from the program itself<\/h2>\n<p>The truth is that on many occasions the menu option we are referring to now goes completely unnoticed.  But we usually remember it when problems start or we have any questions about the application, in this case Word.  With these we mean that when we are faced with a situation of these characteristics, we must take a look at the option <strong>Main menu help<\/strong>.  And it is that we must take into consideration that here we find several options that can be very helpful.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><\/p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that in the first place we find a button called <strong>Comments<\/strong>.  It allows us to communicate to Microsoft our positive and negative opinions about certain functions integrated in the program.  At the same time we will have the possibility of <strong>leave suggestions about those features<\/strong> on which we wish to comment.  But perhaps one of the most interesting functions that we find here is the possibility of contacting the program&#8217;s technical support.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-756207\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653346399_158_Having-trouble-using-Word-Take-advantage-of-these-help-from.jpg\" alt=\"word comments\" width=\"576\" height=\"533\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>How do you expect to imagine this will allow us, directly and in real time, <strong>solve the possible failures that we have found in Word<\/strong>.  Also, if we want to acquire new knowledge about this software, this is the ideal section.  We tell you this because from the Show learning button, Microsoft itself offers us a series of tutorials that will surely be very interesting for us. <strong>delve into this application<\/strong>.
