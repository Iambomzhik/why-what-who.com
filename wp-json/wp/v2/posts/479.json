Shortly after, there was an expansion phase, in which DAZN 3 and DAZN 4 arrived to expand the possibilities of broadcasting simultaneous events.<\/p>\n<p>Later, Movistar Plus+ customers added the registration option and direct access to the DAZN app and to dazn.com.  Now a new step forward is taken with the complete integration of its app in the UHD decoder so that customers with an active subscription to DAZN do not need to go out to see it in another way.  From Movistar Plus+ itself, all its content can be accessed simply and directly, both live and on demand.<\/p>\n<h2>DAZN app on UHD deco<\/h2>\n<p>Starting today, Movistar Plus+ customers will be able to find the DAZN app in the main menu, near Netflix, Disney+ and others.  It can also be accessed from the search engine or directly assigned to dial 103 of Movistar Plus+.  If we directly access DAZN 1 (dial 59), DAZN 2 (dial 60), DAZN 3 (dial 177) or DAZN 4 (dial 178), a direct access to the app will be displayed.
