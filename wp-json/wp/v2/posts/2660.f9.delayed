It is not going to be that some athlete is interested in putting one up for sale, go to a <strong>gold buying establishment<\/strong> and get a surprise&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Well, as you may have guessed, the gold medals that are awarded at the Olympic ceremonies do not contain exactly a lot of gold. Today, Olympic gold medals are made up of 92.5% silver, 6.16% copper and <strong>1.34% gold<\/strong>. Of course, the International Olympic Committee establishes that each gold medal must contain at least 6 grams of this 24-carat metal.<\/p>\n<p>But there was a time in the past when gold medals were made entirely of this precious metal, although we must go back to the 1912 Olympic Games, the last year in which these medals had such a valuable composition.<\/p>\n<p>It is clear that the value of these medals goes far beyond what would be paid based only on their composition. Therefore, more than the establishments of <strong>Buying and selling gold<\/strong>, it is the private collectors who set their sights on these specimens, many of them loaded with symbolism and history. This is the case of the million and a half dollars that they paid in 2013 for the last of the four gold coins that Jesse Owens got.<\/p>\n<p>The last coins delivered at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games were manufactured by the Brazilian Mint and became the heaviest in history with a diameter of 85 millimeters and a weight of 500 grams. In addition, these coins included in their design some laurel leaves that surrounded the Rio 2016 logo with which it was intended to symbolize sporting excellence and claim a return to the spirit of ancient Greece.<\/p>\n<p>Surely from now on you will look with different eyes at the delivery of these decorations knowing that they are not as golden as they seem. So if you are thinking <strong>invest in gold<\/strong>better not bet on these medals and go to an establishment of <strong>Buying and selling gold<\/strong> What <strong>CIODE<\/strong> where you can buy bars or coins at the best market price. No surprises or doubts. Come see us and we will advise you on both the sale and purchase of precious metals.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Surely no Olympic champion ever thinks of selling the gold medals that they have been able to achieve during their sports life and that symbolize their greatest triumphs&#8230; but as you never know, today we will tell you in this post what those medals are really made of that are delivered at the top of [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2661,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2660"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2660"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2660\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2835,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2660\/revisions\/2835"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2661"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2660"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2660"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2660"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
