Android devices actually have a lot more data in the form of songs or apps, for example.  It can be a bit tedious to move around them with the options provided by the default devices, but for that we have, as in Windows, <strong>some very interesting file explorers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>File explorers on Android are, by now, almost as important as they are on Microsoft&#8217;s operating system.  When you get used to having one installed and using it, you won&#8217;t know how to live without it.  Google has its own, <strong>called files<\/strong>but we also give you some alternatives that also work very well.<\/p>\n<h2>Google Files<\/h2>\n<p>Google has free solutions in its catalog for practically anything that comes to mind, and of course it was not going to be different with our files.  Files is a great application that we will be able to enjoy <strong>on any Android mobile<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>    <img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Google-Files-and-other-file-explorers-for-Android.png\" alt=\"Google Files\"\/>     <\/p>\n<p>This application does not take up much space on our device, <strong>And it doesn&#8217;t spend a lot of resources like this either.<\/strong>.  Its operation is based on three pillars: free up space (both on the phone and on the SD card if we have one), find files quickly and be able to share them quickly through WiFi.<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1671192\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Google-Files-and-other-file-explorers-for-Android.jpg\" alt=\"files\" width=\"715\" height=\"420\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Files also allows us to encrypt our files with WPA2, and even back them up in the cloud.  One thing about Files that&#8217;s great is that it will give us <strong>suggestions on files that we can delete to free up space<\/strong>depending on factors such as the little use we are giving them.<\/p>\n<h2>FileManager<\/h2>\n<p>File Manager is another great alternative if we are looking for a file explorer.  It is a simple application and it has <strong>a no-frills interface<\/strong>.  With it, we can manage the files on our phone, as well as cloud storage and even NAS (network storage).<\/p>\n<p style=\"display:inline-block; width:100%;\"><img viewbox=\"0 0 3 2\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1671198\" src=\"https:\/\/why-what-who.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653266603_210_Google-Files-and-other-file-explorers-for-Android.jpg\" alt=\"filemanager\" width=\"715\" height=\"420\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>The app is free, and <strong>allows us to do all kinds of actions<\/strong> such as searching for files, copying and taking them to other locations or even renaming them.
