										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Maybe the time has come to change your router</h2>
<p>Our router is a fundamental part for the Internet connection to work correctly.  It is what allows us to have a speed <strong>adequate, stability</strong> and avoid problems that cause connection failures.  But you also have to keep in mind that not all routers are the same.</p>
<p>Over time, routers have significantly improved the quality of your connection, knowing how to support more connected devices, with higher transfer speeds and even more wireless coverage.</p>
<p>In this sense, and as the colleagues from<strong> RedesZone</strong>the time may come when we have an older router model at home that may be giving us certain problems when connecting to the Internet or that, simply, we are curious to know if it would be possible to improve the connection using a <strong>latest router</strong>.  At this point you have two possibilities: either you contact your operator to provide you with a new generation model, or choose to buy one on our own.  But what do we have to value?</p>
<h2>What to consider</h2>
<p>In any case, it is important to appreciate that an old or obsolete router can cause problems, both for the Internet and for other uses.  Therefore, we must take into account certain <strong>fundamental aspects</strong> to be able to make a comparison regarding their functions and thus understand when they are stopping working correctly.</p>
<p>With the same connection, if we use a quality router we can appreciate a great improvement in web browsing, but much more in WiFi coverage and the speed obtained, as well as noticing the difference when playing online.</p>
<p>In any case, it is important for you to acquire a new and good equipment that can meet the needs depending on what <strong>needed at home</strong>.  Although the main recommendation is that you buy one that offers you guarantees of at least two years.</p>
<p style="display:inline-block; width:100%;"></p>
<h3>Slow down or low bandwidth issues</h3>
<p>A very important factor is related to the uses of the Internet in the domestic environment and the number of users of a single connection.  If there are several of us at home, or we have a multitude of terminals associated with a network, sometimes <strong>slowdown issues</strong> very significant.  It is when it is said that the bandwidth of our router <strong>is short</strong> and our slow internet.  In these cases, it may be necessary to purchase another device.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that we have more and more devices connected to the network.  We especially talk about what is known as the Internet of Things.  This will mean that they need to have adequate bandwidth.  We must avoid problems and that the router cannot offer what the devices require.</p>
<h3>Is it WiFi 6 compatible?</h3>
<p>In this direction, a key approach also emerges: WiFi 6: if our router is not compatible with this standard, that will make it even more evident that we must get a new one.</p>
<p>Thus, in the technical file of the device, they should include either the official name or the name of the standard.  Sometimes it will just say something like &#8220;Wifi 802.11ax&#8221; or, more succinctly, &#8220;Wi-Fi b, g, n, ac, ax.&#8221;  Each letter refers to a WiFi standard.  What interests us is<strong>x, equivalent to Wi-Fi 6.</strong></p>
<p style="display:inline-block; width:100%;"><img viewbox="0 0 3 2" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1647660 size-full" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1657618033_926_So-you-can-know-if-you-should-buy-a-new.jpg" alt="Router internet speed test" width="768" height="425"  /></p>
<h3>Poor results in speed tests</h3>
<p>Another very important problem that can occur with our router and its Internet connection can be detected through speed tests, which will test the network frequency.  We recommend that two tests be done: one of the wireless network and the other by connecting the Ethernet cable to a computer.</p>
<p>If the result of the connection with the cable is superior, it is necessary to do the test again.  If the numbers are still different, the router may no longer be working as it should and it&#8217;s time to make that change.</p>
<h3>number of ports</h3>
<p>Starting from the basis that it is normal to have fiber, we must begin to make distinctions.  If your router is capable of providing two networks, one 2.4 GHz and one 5 GHz, it falls into the category of modern routers;  although if it is linked to the fiber, the better.</p>
<p>And there comes the <strong>number of ports</strong> that the device has.  They typically have four Ethernet ports.  Some have more and others may have just one or two, depending on the case.  Generally with four ports it is enough for a house.  For its part, in addition, the clear indication will be if it does not have a port <strong>GigabitEthernet, </strong>what it means is that it is a fairly old router.</p>

<p>In addition to the host country, several have already qualified for the championship, including favorites Brazil, Argentina, Germany and defending champion France.</p>
<p>This is how the quotas are distributed:</p>
<p><strong>Europe &#8211; UEFA: 13 places<br />
</strong><strong>Africa &#8211; CAF:</strong> 5 slots<br />
<strong>South America &#8211; Conmebol:</strong> 4.5 seats<br />
<strong style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Asia-AFC:</strong> 4.5 seats<br />
<strong>North America, Central America and the Caribbean &#8211; Concacaf:</strong> 3.5 seats<br />
<strong>Oceania &#8211; OFC:</strong> 0.5 slots</p>
<h2>World Cup Calendar</h2>
<p>The opening match of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 will take place on <strong>November 21, 2022 at 1:00 pm local time</strong> (05:00 am, Miami time) at the Al Bayt Stadium, a stadium with a capacity for 60,000 spectators.</p>
<p>Local times for group stage matches will be 01:00 pm, 04:00 pm, 07:00 pm and 10:00 pm; while the matches of the last day of this phase, as well as the subsequent qualifiers, will be played simultaneously at 06:00 pm and 10:00 pm</p>
<p>Khalifa International Stadium will host the third-place match on December 17, while the final will be played at 06:00 pm local time at Lusail Stadium in front of 80,000 spectators.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to give all the teams enough time to recover, the group stage will last twelve days, with four games a day being played, so the schedule promises to be very exciting,&#8221; FIFA said. .</p>
<p>FIFA has said that &#8220;the stadium and the schedule of the group stage matches for each of the days will be decided after the final draw, scheduled for after the March 2022 qualifiers&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once the pairings are known, the possibility of assigning the best times depending on television audiences and also for fans traveling to Qatar, depending on the ideal stadium, will be assessed,&#8221; FIFA said.</p>
<h2>Tickets sale</h2>
<p><strong>Tickets for the 2022 Qatar World Cup go on sale with prices reaching US$1,600</strong></p>
<p>Prices vary depending on the match and the seat category chosen, with tickets for the final ranging from US$604 to US$1,600.</p>
<p>It may seem like a high price, but by comparison, some official tickets to this year&#8217;s Super Bowl start at $5,950.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are curious about how it works, you don&#8217;t need to rent expensive recording studios, you can do<strong> your first steps with Autotune directly from the microphone of your smartphone</strong> with these Android apps.</p>
<h2>Voloco: Vocal Studio</h2>
<p>Voloco automatically removes background noise and lets you correct the pitch of your voice to stay in tune.  Voloco also gives you a variety of presets for compression, EQ, and reverb effects to polish your recording to perfection.</p>
<p> <iframe title="How To Make Songs in VOLOCO // VOLOCO Recording Vocals Tutorial 2022 // Make a Track in Voloco" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/acRn-VllhHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>
<p>Applying Voloco effects to audio you record elsewhere is easy.  You can also apply Voloco effects to the voices of pre-recorded videos.  This app offers <strong>50+ effects bundled into 12 preset packs</strong>.</p>
<p>      <img viewbox="0 0 3 2" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Autotune-Apps-for-Android.png" alt="Voloco: Vocal Studio"/>     </p>
<h2>tune me</h2>
<p>Tune Me is an app that is specifically designed to record hip-hop and R&#038;B tracks, although it can obviously still be used for other types of musical genres.  You can record your voice and add modifications such as Autotune, pitch changes and more than 50 effects and rhythms to accompany your recording.</p>
<p> <img viewbox="0 0 3 2" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1689021" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1689021" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Autotune-Apps-for-Android.jpg" alt="Tune Me App" width="281" height="500"  /></p>
<p id="caption-attachment-1689021" class="wp-caption-text">Tune Me App</p>
<p>Another important function is its wave display and equalizer, which allows you to identify and correct each sound in your recording with perfect precision.</p>
<p>  <img viewbox="0 0 3 2" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Autotune-Apps-for-Android.tuneme&#038;chs=200x200&#038;chld=L|0.png" alt="tune me"/>  <img viewbox="0 0 3 2" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653901862_628_Best-Autotune-Apps-for-Android.png" alt="tune me"/>     </p>
<h2>AudioLab</h2>
<p>AudioLab is one of the most complete audio editors that exist for Android.  In order to modify your voice, it includes functions such as audio trimming (cut, trim, copy, paste, add silence, fade, undo, redo), audio mix (mix four audios, change speed and pitch, DJ effects and filters), detailed tag editing, audio merger, audio recorder, audio converter, music player, voice editor and many more features.</p>
<p> <iframe title="AudioLab - Best Audio Editor &amp; Ringtone Maker App" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aimn6dkk3ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>
<p>At the Autotune level, it can be a bit complicated to use if you are a beginner, because it is more focused on a somewhat more professional audience, but since it is free, you can always try to see if you can get hold of it.</p>
<p>  <img viewbox="0 0 3 2" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Autotune-Apps-for-Android.audioeditor&#038;chs=200x200&#038;chld=L|0.png" alt="AudioLab - Audio Editor &#038; Ringtone Maker"/>  <img viewbox="0 0 3 2" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653901862_339_Best-Autotune-Apps-for-Android.png" alt="AudioLab - Audio Editor &#038; Ringtone Maker"/>     </p>
<h2>Voice changer, voice recorder and editor</h2>
<p>Despite the lack of commerciality of its name and simply being a description of its functions, this app is quite interesting.  If you prefer to take the upper hand and be the one who modifies your voice to your liking, you will like this app.</p>
<p> <img viewbox="0 0 3 2" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1689024" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1689024" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653901862_199_Best-Autotune-Apps-for-Android.jpg" alt="Voice effects app" width="715" height="349"  /></p>
<p id="caption-attachment-1689024" class="wp-caption-text">Voice Effects App</p>
<p>Its main function is to modify your voice with Autotune, Voicemod, etc.  Song recording can be done in different qualities, from 32 kbps to 320 kbps.  In addition to processing the recorded voice and adding more than 20 voice effects, the voice and music editor functionality is suitable for karaoke lovers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;"></p>
<p>We can also pause our favorite background images and search directly in the Unsplash library among more than a million photos. We will can <strong>see basic information of each photo</strong>, such as the location, the ISO, the camera model with which it was captured, the shutter speed, among other parameters. In addition, we can see the images of the last ten open tabs and update the current background image with any of them.</p>
<p>We can download and install Stella Photos from the Firefox extensions website.</p>
<h3>Image Picka, download photos in batches</h3>
<p>We are talking about a free and open source extension that will allow us to <strong>download an image with just drag and drop</strong> or by pressing Ctrl/Shift/Alt + click. We will be able to download all the images that we want in batches, either from the current tab or from the tab on the right. It is possible to filter images based on width, minimum or maximum height, file size, image URL, as well as copy URLs of selected images.</p>
<p style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-725646 size-full" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653900493_615_Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.jpg" alt="Image Picka" width="900" height="480" /></p>
<p>We can also give a custom file name, handle invalid characters in the file name, download from the browser cache, and even transform the URL with find and replace. The plugin works well with most websites, though <strong>with Instagram we can find some problems</strong>because it only shows us white squares instead of the images that we can choose and save.</p>
<p>Download Image Picka from the Firefox Browser Add-ons.</p>
<p><img src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.org/es/firefox/addon/image-picka/&amp;chs=200x200&amp;chld=L|0.png" alt="Image Picka" /> <img src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653900494_864_Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.png" alt="Image Picka" /></p>
<h3>Download Image from Context Menu, download photos from the context menu</h3>
<p>By using this plugin we can use the context menu to <strong>download images directly</strong> without any notice. This, which seems like something so simple, can be very useful since it will allow us to save several photos at the same time. By simply pressing the Enter key after each save, we will avoid going through the annoying “Save As” message.</p>
<p style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-727809 size-full" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653900494_899_Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.jpg" alt="Download Image from Context Menu Firefox" width="500" height="845" /></p>
<p>In order to use this extension correctly, it is important that we do not have the Strict option established in Firefox&#8217;s privacy options, since this mode interferes with the extension when downloading images that do not have valid file types. However, this does not affect the content of the file and it can be opened if we provide a valid extension.</p>
<p>If we want to use it, all we have to do is download Download Image from Context Menu from the Firefox website.</p>
<p><img src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653900494_425_Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.png" alt="Download Image from Context Menu" /></p>
<h2>Extensions to enjoy music</h2>
<p>For music lovers or simply for those who listen to audio from the browser, these extensions for Firefox allow us to improve our experience when playing sound.</p>
<h3>Audio Equalizer, configure the audio you hear through the browser</h3>
<p>It is a complement that will allow us to easily adjust the <strong>audio setup</strong> that we want to hear from a toolbar pop-up. In this way we can find the perfect balance between the components of the sound file. For this, we will have several preset settings to be able to choose from a list, such as pop, club, party, rock, among other preset formats.</p>
<p style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-725652 size-full" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653900494_77_Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.jpg" alt="Sound Equalizer" width="940" height="619" /></p>
<p>It is also possible to define our own format to later save it inside the toolbar popup and use it when needed. In addition, it has a reset button through which we will be able to revert all the changes made to the factory settings. For people with hearing problems and who are deaf in one ear, the extension<strong> has a Mono function</strong>so you never miss a word or sound when listening to music through headphones.</p>
<p>We can download Audio Equalizer from the Firefox website.</p>

<h3>SoundFixer, fix problems with sound volume</h3>
<p>This extension has been conceived to solve any sound problem associated with streaming videos, whether listening to music or audio from different websites, with single channel audio, or too loud or too soft. It is compatible with such popular websites as YouTube, Netflix, Twitch or Amazon Prime, if it can work equally on all websites.</p>
<p style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-725655 size-full" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653900494_215_Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.jpg" alt="soundfixer" width="900" height="487" /></p>
<p>With SoundFixer we will be able to sensibly understand any YouTube video that is recorded with a very low tone of voice and we are not able to listen correctly. And it is that Google&#8217;s video platform usually only uses 30% of the maximum volume, so with this add-on we can play our favorite music at full volume.</p>
<p>SoundFixer is a free add-on that we can download from the Firefox Browser Add-ons.</p>
<p><img src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653900494_457_Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.png" alt="soundfixer" /></p>
<h3>600% Sound Volume, increase the volume to the maximum</h3>
<p>We are talking about an extension that is characterized by being a volume amplifier as simple as it is reliable. With it we will be able to increase the volume of a song or any audio up to 600% more than its maximum, being able to easily control the volume from any tab. It has a detailed control that allows<strong> adjust the volume between 0% and 600%</strong> and change it in any tab we play audio with one click.</p>
<p style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-725667 size-full" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653900494_995_Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.jpg" alt="600% Sound Volume" width="700" height="526" /></p>
<p>Of course, we must bear in mind that the complement does not work miracles either, because the more we increase the sound of the audio that we are listening to, the more its quality will decrease, although in general terms it is still good and does not distort too much, even at the highest volumes.</p>
<p>If we want to use the 600% Sound Volume extension, we must know that it is free and we can download its latest version available from the Firefox extensions website.</p>
<p><img src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653900494_293_Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.png" alt="600% Sound Volume" /></p>
<h2>Add-ons to download videos in Firefox</h2>
<p>If we like to watch videos on the Internet with these extensions, we can download them directly to our hard drive to be able to watch them without having to be connected to the Internet.</p>
<h3>Video DownloadHelper, extract videos from any website</h3>
<p>We are talking about a complete tool to be able to <strong>extract videos from different websites</strong> and save them to the hard drive. Every time the plugin detects a video embedded in the website that we are visiting, we can download them by clicking on the icon on the toolbar, which will result in the result, so we only have to click.</p>
<p style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-725670 size-full" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653900494_798_Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.jpg" alt="Video DownloadHelper" width="853" height="489" /></p>
<p>It is compatible with the main video storage pages such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitch, Vimeo, among others. We just have to be careful not to download videos protected by copyright. In addition to downloading, Video DownloadHelper is also capable of converting audio and video files to different formats, as well as combining audio and video separately into a single file.</p>
<p>We can download Video DownloadHelper from the Firefox extensions website.</p>
<p><img src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653900494_917_Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.png" alt="Video DownloadHelper" /></p>
<h3>Video Downloader professional, save videos up to 4K</h3>
<p>This extension for Firefox allows us <strong>download and save to our hard drive</strong>, any video embedded in a website, being able to support up to 4K resolutions. It is compatible with such popular websites as YouTube and Vimeo, from where it allows us to play videos in any size from the window.</p>
<p style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-725673 size-full" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653900494_295_Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.jpg" alt="Video Downloader Professional" width="900" height="558" /></p>
<p>It also allows us to easily add videos to our video list to have quick access to them whenever we want and can play or download them. Of course, this plugin currently does not support the download of videos protected by the RTMP protocol, so we must use them with videos that do not have copyright.</p>
<p>We can download professional Video Downloader from Firefox.</p>
<p><img src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653900494_16_Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.png" alt="Video Downloader Professional" /></p>
<h3>Easy Video Downloader, download audio and video</h3>
<p>We are talking about a complement that allows us<strong> download both audio and video</strong> as it works with its own internal and external download manager like IDM or Wget. We simply have to visit a website and press its button located on the toolbar, so that all the available audio and video sources are listed. We press what we want to download and start downloading it.</p>
<p style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-725679 size-full" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653900494_230_Photo-music-and-video-extensions-for-Mozilla-Firefox.jpg" alt="Easy Video Downloader" width="700" height="438" /></p>
<p>It also makes other features available to us, such as the ability to track the information of any image by simply clicking the right button on the toolbar. Also, we can interrupt the download at any time and copy the download links to the clipboard.</p>
<p>Download Easy Video Downloader from the Firefox website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p>As expected, the very serious inflation in March provided the right climate for a new round of the government internal election to be held. Really, it is difficult to find differences with other previous episodes. The president once again put up with the offending comments from his vice president and, once again, asked his allies for patience because he would make decisions after Easter. Alberto&#8217;s credibility reached a point of no return and no one imagines him asking Wado de Pedro to resign, for example. In reality, the entire crisis is synthesized in the removal or not of Martín Guzmán. The president -according to some of those close to him- would believe that he can save the clothes if Guzmán&#8217;s successor is not a cristinista. On this, he would be negotiating and yesterday&#8217;s media offensive to run for Buenos Aires Production Minister Eduardo Costa would have been a reaction by the hardest Kirchnerists to sabotage any negotiation.</p>
<h4><strong>The perpetuation of the crisis</strong></h4>
<p>The substantial difference with the previous episodes is the passage of time. The political erosion of the government is increasingly serious and it is worth wondering if this unstable balance can continue. In fact, if Cristina continues to press and Alberto continues without reacting, the conflict could go on forever until reaching the electoral stage at the end of the year. It is not unthinkable and it remains to be seen if this continues, if Alberto will maintain his intention to be re-elected and if she is consistent with his speech and vetoes it.</p>
<p>We are projecting a future scenario that seems about to explode. But we must remember that when the crisis between the president and the vice president deepened three months ago, all forecasts predicted a brief episode, which did not happen.</p>
<p>The prolongation of the conflict is undoubtedly due to a greater extent to Alberto&#8217;s refusal to exercise power, allowing her to continue to have political centrality. It gives the impression that Guzmán&#8217;s days in government are numbered, which does not mean that the crisis is over.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Real Madrid will have 20,000 tickets for the Champions League final on March 28 to distribute among its members.</p>
<p>The form to purchase any of the tickets for the Stade de France is now available on the official website of Real Madrid.  The only fundamental requirement to request it is to be a member of the club. </p><source data- media="(max-width: 419px)"/><source data- media="(max-width: 767px)"/><source data- media="(max-width: 989px)"/><source data- media="(min-width: 989px)"/></p>
<p class="subtitle">Season ticket holders will have to ask Real Madrid for tickets for the Champions League final, which will be distributed by lottery.</p>
<p>Once inside the private members area, each request can include from one to six locations.  In any case, it will be mandatory to indicate the name and member number for which each request is made.  And once all the fields have been filled in, Real Madrid assigns a number per request.</p>
<p>The deadline is May 10 at 11:59 p.m.  On the 11th, Real Madrid will hold a draw by means of a notary public.  A number will be drawn randomly and it will be the number from which requests start to be counted to where the tickets arrive.</p>
<h2>Real Madrid warns: tickets are nominative</h2>
<p>The tickets, as Real Madrid recalls, are nominative.  It will pursue the resale and will have the measures it deems appropriate in case of reselling the tickets or making fraudulent use of them.</p>
<p>The club, as it did in previous editions, it is likely that a small percentage of the 20,000 seats that correspond to it will go to managers, players, employees, the VIP area, club commitments and members with more seniority.  But it guarantees that 80% of the total will go to the draw among the requesting members.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among the wide range of web browsers to choose from that we currently have, users prioritize some aspects over others.  Although sometimes these software solutions may seem the same, they are not.  Next, we will talk about two widely known proposals that are very different from each other, such as <strong>Chrome and Tor</strong>.</p>
<p>First of all, we must bear in mind that, if we focus on the browser offered by the search giant <strong>Google</strong>, it is the most used.  In addition, the difference with respect to its competitors is enormous.  Chrome currently has a market penetration of around 65% of the global market in this sector.  On the other hand, we find another proposal that could be considered as one of the most distant in terms of operation, but that has much fewer users.</p>
<p style="display:inline-block; width:100%;"></p>
<p>With everything and with it if we talk about <strong>Tor Browser</strong>, we find a software that has its followers due to certain functionalities and behaviors that it offers.  Everything will depend on the demands that each user has or the needs that need to be covered.  Precisely for all this, below we are going to talk about the main differences that we are going to find between these two popular alternatives.</p>
<p>The truth is that there are many users around the world who tend to <strong>install both proposals</strong> and use them depending on the moment.  This is something we can understand more clearly once we know the <strong>differences between both browsers</strong>, Which are important.  Next, we will show you some of the most significant ones so that you can get a funny idea of ​​where Google Chrome and Tor Browser are headed.</p>
<p style="display:inline-block; width:100%;"><img viewbox="0 0 3 2" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-456022" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653846923_395_Differences-between-Google-Chrome-and-Tor.jpg" alt="Thor" width="1000" height="587"  /></p>
<h2>Which to choose, Chrome or Tor Browser</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy, differentiating element</strong>: There is no doubt that the biggest difference between both proposals is in privacy.  While Google and its telemetry and tracking are behind the development of Chrome, Tor is the private browser par excellence.  In fact, it uses its own private network to avoid the monitoring and storage of data by the pages.</li>
<li><strong>The engine they are based on</strong>: how could it be otherwise, Google&#8217;s proposal is based on the Chromium engine used by most current browsers.  On the contrary, the proposal focused on privacy bets on Mozilla Firefox and its development engine.  Despite being less used, everything related to security and privacy is very important here.</li>
<li><strong>The smoothness of operation</strong>: However, one of the biggest drawbacks that we find in Tor is that access to web pages is somewhat slower in general terms.  This is something that can be clearly seen if we compare this section with Google&#8217;s proposal, it is the price of privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Compatible Devices</strong>: It is also important to consider compatible systems and devices.  We can use Chrome on almost all platforms and computers, both desktop and mobile, but Tor is a bit more limited in this regard.</li>
<li><strong>Use of extensions</strong>: If we focus on Tor Browser, we will tell you that the use of extensions here is also much more limited than in Chrome.  In fact, most of the developers of these plugins release them for the Google browser and those compatible with Chromium.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Occasionally opportunities arise that it is highly recommended not to miss.  This is exactly what is happening right now on Amazon, as you can buy a phone <strong>Xiaomi LITTLE</strong> with a price rarely seen to date.  And, among other virtues, it has to offer connectivity <strong>5G</strong>.</p>
<p>The model we are talking about, which is finished in black and has an attractive design -since it does not lack a small hole in the screen for the camera for selfies and that the frontal use exceeds 85%-, has details as interesting such as offering <strong>protection against water and dust</strong> or offering excellent connectivity this Xiaomi POCO F3 where it is not lacking <strong>NFC or Wi-Fi 6</strong>.</p>
<p style="display:inline-block; width:100%;"></p>
<h2>This Xiaomi POCO is, above all, very complete</h2>
<p>On the one hand, this is so because the terminal has quite powerful hardware.  An example is that your <strong>RAM is 6GB</strong> and, in addition, the processor does not clash because the one used is a <strong>Snapdragon 870</strong> with eight cores and a maximum working frequency of up to 3.2 GHz. This ensures that everything you have to do is achieved with excellent fluidity, no matter how demanding it is.  Even the games go like a shot because its GPU is an Adreno 650.</p>
<p>As if this were not enough, it should be noted that the <strong>storage</strong> that it includes is type UFS 3.1 to ensure a high speed of work, being its capacity of <strong>128GB</strong>.  In other words, you won&#8217;t have to constantly resort to the cloud to save information.  If you are wondering about the screen, very important to achieve the best possible user experience, the manufacturer has made an excellent choice: its panel <strong>AMOLED is 6.67 inches</strong> with Full HD + resolution and, apart from that, it has options as striking as the use of a maximum frequency of 120 Hz or a maximum brightness of no less than 1,300 nits.  An atrocity!</p>
<p style="display:inline-block; width:100%;"><img viewbox="0 0 3 2" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1689099" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653840512_428_this-Xiaomi-with-5G-and-120-Hz-at-an-unbeatable.jpg" alt="Back of Xiaomi POCO F3 phone" width="1000" height="500"></p>
<h2>Autonomy and camera: no problems</h2>
<p>In the first case, without offering particularly differential options, this Xiaomi POCO F3 does quite well.  The reason for saying this is that it has a battery of <strong>4,502mAh</strong> (which is not bad for a terminal that weighs less than 200 grams and is 7.8 millimeters thick).  In addition, its fast charge is <strong>33W</strong>.  Therefore, you will not have any complaints in this section, since the smartphone complies.</p>
<p>If you are wondering about the main camera that integrates this device that uses the Android operating system (with MIUI customization), it must be said that it complies, since, among other things, you can record without problems at 4K quality without the slightest problem.  This is achieved because the combination of sensors is as follows: <strong>48 + 8 + 5MP</strong>offering good possibilities when taking photos in low light or if you want to take macro shots.</p>
<p>The truth is that little more can be asked of a phone that right now has a 36% discount on Amazon, which is a quite remarkable amount.  Therefore, if you are thinking of renewing your mobile, you should seriously value this Xiaomi POCO F3, since it has no cracks and it does not lack advanced options such as including <strong>fingerprint reader</strong> -in this case mounted on the power button on the side-.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A hard drive can fail for various reasons, and one of the most important can be found in the<strong> excessive temperature</strong> to which we submit them when we work with the PC, and this is where an application like CrystalDiskInfo can be very useful, since it will offer us a good amount of data in an orderly and efficient way.</p>
<p>And we are talking about software that is as simple as it is powerful, and once executed, it will take care of offering us <strong>real time information</strong> of details as important as the brand, model, serial number, among other elements, and indicating the state in which it is found.</p>
<h2>How does it work</h2>
<p>Once we run the program, its main interface appears where we will find all kinds of detailed information.  Among the information that the program shows us, it is worth highlighting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health condition</strong>: is responsible for making an average of all the values ​​and tells us what state the disk is in.</li>
<li><strong>Temperature</strong>: from here it shows us the temperature of the disk, so to avoid problems it is convenient that it be as low as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Device Overview</strong>: In this section we can see the brand, model, firmware, operating time and other general information about the HDD or SSD.</li>
<li><strong>Individual SMART information</strong>: here, we can see the status of each of the points controlled by the SMART to know if, although the disk appears to be fine, there is a point where it could fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the upper part we find several tabs, where it is convenient to highlight its section of <strong>Function</strong>from where, we find the different functions that we can carry out with the program.</p>
<p style="display:inline-block; width:100%;"></p>
<p>From here we have different options to determine how and how often the program data is refreshed.  It also has the function of <strong>Graph</strong> from where we can see the behavior of the available memories.  We can also<strong> hide serial number</strong>something that can be very useful if we are going to share screenshots of the program.</p>
<p style="display:inline-block; width:100%;"><img viewbox="0 0 3 2" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-728037 size-full" src="https://why-what-who.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653835913_327_Know-all-the-data-on-the-hard-drive-or-SSD.jpg" alt="CrystalDiskInfo Advanced Options" width="900" height="898"  /></p>
<p>Another interesting section is its <strong>Advanced Options</strong> from where we will be able to configure the temperature scale, the waiting time to start the program, carry out an advanced search for hard drives or hide the information that SMART offers us.</p>
<h2>Is it worth using?</h2>
<p>This software is responsible for providing us with a complete reading of all the SMART information of our PC, as well as the current temperature and its health status.  It has a clear interface that makes it easy for us to find all the information we need.  On the contrary, it is also worth mentioning that unless we have a certain knowledge of the information that it shows us, we will not be able to deduce much from it, since it does not have any help or explanation function for the data that it offers.  That is why in order to take full advantage of it, it must be used mainly by <strong>Advanced users</strong>.  In this case, you apply with an excellent free option.</p>
<h2>Free download</h2>
<p>CrystalDiskInfo is a<strong> free Software,</strong> so we can use it without having to pay a single euro, by simply downloading it from its official website.  The program is compatible with Windows in its different versions up to Windows 11, as well as with 32-bit and 64-bit systems.</p>
<p>It has three download options since we can choose from different skins: Standard Edition, Shizuku Edition and Kurei Kei Edition.  All the options are identical in terms of the software content, since it only modifies the aesthetic section.  In each of the versions we will have up to four sections for downloading the program, either compressed or uncompressed, as well as installable or portable.</p>
<p>Of course we will recommend the <strong>wearable version,</strong> since it does not require installation and therefore does not modify the Windows registry.  In addition, we can run it directly from any external storage device such as a hard drive, a flash drive, or even a memory card.</p>
<h2>Other alternatives</h2>
<p>If we are looking for a program with which we can find out the status of our hard drive or SSD, we can also opt for one of these alternatives to CrystalDiskInfo:</p>
<h3>HD Tune</h3>
<p>We are talking about a program with which we can carry out a visual analysis of our hard drive and check its internal behavior.  It also scans your SMART data as well as your bad sectors.  In addition, it is also used to measure the temperature of the HDD or SSD and its hours of use.  We can download HD Tune from the developer&#8217;s website.</p>
<h3>DiskCheckup</h3>
<p>It is a program with which we are going to be able to carry out basic diagnostic work on the state of the storage units that we have on our computer, being able to monitor the SMART data, and even configure alarms so that the program notifies us in the event that the hard drive reaches a high temperature.  If we want to try DiskCheckup, we can download it from its main web page.</p>
